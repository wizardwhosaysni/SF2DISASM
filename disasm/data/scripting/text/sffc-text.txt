=How are you feeling, Adam?{N}Are the repairs working, I wonder?{W1}
=It's hopeless. I don't think I'll be able to fight anymore.{W2}
=The others will be able to fight though, they're strong enough.{N}We should set out to find Max as soon as possible.{W1}
=If you think it's necessary Adam, set up a pursuing party.{W1}
=Indeed. I must protect Master Max, and prevent the entire world from being destroyed!{W2}
=For that reason, we should leave here and try to pick up his trail.{N}Don't worry though, we'll be back.{W1}
=Adam should be doing fine now.{W2}
=When we brought him here to Hassan, I was worried he might never return to normal.{W1}
=There's no need to worry, Mead. There's a self-repairing mechanism inside me.{W2}
=I may not be completely repaired yet, but I'm not about to become a useless lump of metal!{W1}
=Nonetheless, we'll still worry a little.{N}Adam is delicate, unlike Mead!{W1}
=That's right, Paige. Who would have imagined how Adam managed to recover?!{W2}
=For an apprentice mage like Hawel, this will be the sight of a lifetime!{W1}
=What are you saying about me this time, Sonette?{W1}
=Do you really think that I'm just some useless academic?{W2}
=I've already taught you so much. What a waste of time! {W1}
=Just kidding, just kidding!{N}I've often had to depend on you and your experience, Hawel.{W1}
=Okay, is everybody here?{N}Well, let's journey to the ancient temple to see what devils we must face!{W1}
=Just a minute!{N}Shouldn't Knuckles be going with us?{W1}
=That lazybones must have slept in again. He's really let Max down this time, he doesn't deserve to come with us.{W2}
=He's always late, and we always have to wait for him. We'll be waiting all day for him to wake up and get here!{W1}
=That's right. There's no reason to let him delay us.{N}When he comes out, he can join us. Let's go now.{W1}
=Oh dear! Knuckles, what shall we do with you!{N}If he shows up, I'll tell him you've already left.{W1}
=Thank you. We couldn't ask for more.{W1}
=Well then, Elder, our group should leave for the Ancient temple now. We'll return soon.{W1}
=I'll be here waiting for you.{W1}
=Grandpa, could {LEADER} please have a word with you?{W1}
=Alright.{N}Wait inside, I'll be there in a moment.{W1}
={LEADER} became lost on his journey and came to Hassan by coincidence.{W2}
=I believe {LEADER} has something to tell Adam, too...{W2}
=...but I suppose he will have to wait until you return.{W1}
=Well then....{N}Let's go to the ancient temple!{W1}
=Hey! Wait up!{N}I'm all set to come along and do my best!{W1}
=Knuckles, it's you!{N}What in the world were you thinking, arriving so late?!{W2}
=If you hadn't got here in time, we'd be setting off for the ancient temple without you!{W1}
=Ha ha!{N}Sorry, sorry!{W2}
=I slept in late... then rushed to get ready!{N}I'm here because I know how important this is.{W1}
=Come along then, it's time to depart.{W1}
=Well everyone, let's go!{W1}
=So Adam and his companions headed for the ancient temple to search for Max's trail, however...{W1}
=This...{N}Is this it?{W1}
=It is!{N}This is the Caravan...{N}It's said to be a very convenient means of transportation.{W1}
=I... I don't understand!{N}How do you get this thing to move?{N}If we could only work out how to get inside...{W1}
=Oh well, that woman said it's okay to break it if we can't make it work.
=He's going to damage that ancient relic!{W1}
=Someone just had to come and spoil this...{N}We'll abandon the caravan for now. Let's get out of here!{W2}
=Hey, you!{N}A thief like me is skilled enough to escape. Men, why don't you keep them company?{W1}
=The enemy is coming!{W1}
=Adam, you can't fight, but we can!{W1}
=Understood. Well then Mead, please lead them!{W1}
=What?!{N}My men can't have been defeated!{W2}
=I think now's the time for a hasty exit.{W1}
=I suppose you must be one of Mishaela's minions, since you're here at the ancient temple trying to damage things.{W2}
=We can't let you go free until we have decided there is good reason to do so.{W1}
={LEADER} and the Force were now intent on heading north to Pacalon. To get there, they must pass through a cave...{W1}
=This cave is really long, isn't it?{W1}
=It's just too narrow. I'm having trouble flying in here!{W1}
=Aww, quit complaining.{N}The way out can't be too far now...{W2}
=Hey! I just felt a breeze on my skin!{W1}
=Hold on Hawel... why do you always act like you're some great know-it-all?{W1}
=Whatever. This cave is bound to come out somewhere in the region of Pacalon.{W2}
=We can take some time to have a well-deserved rest after we get out.{W1}
=What's that?!{W2}
=I think I just saw someone over there... a shadow moved.{N}This could mean danger.{W1}
=Eh?{N}We don't need that sort of thinking. It's nothing.{W1}
=No, I'm sure it was somebody.{N}Hello...? Is anyone there?{W1}
=Do you have to shout so loud?! That could be Mishaela's squad ahead of us, what shall we do?{W1}
=Hey, did I hear somebody's voice just now?{W1}
=Oooh, I heard that too!{N}Are they the ones that Master Magus is searching for?{W1}
=Alright!{N}I'll attack first!{W1}
=The cave is shaking!{W1}
=Eek! The pillars!{W1}
=It's the enemy!{N}Attack them, everyone, but be careful!{W1}
=They're still coming?{N}Then I'll try again!{W1}
=Master Magus! We've been discovered...{N}Th... they're here.... uuggghh{N}...{W1}
=It's just a matter of time until the enemy finds us...{W2}
={LEADER}, we must make haste!{W1}
=Fight!{N}If we defeat them in this battle, we can take over the city of Pacalon!{W1}
=You're too slow!{N}Why do some of the Pacalon troops still remain undefeated?!{W1}
=Well, Master Magus...{N}The Pacalon force have grouped together in resistance - we can't defeat them!{W1}
=Then they leave me no other choice...{W2}
=We'll make that river overflow! Pacalon's soldiers will have a drink of water like they've never had before!{N}Heh heh heh!{W1}
=Heh heh heh! Good, it worked.{W2}
=They soon lost their fighting spirit!{N}Now everybody, let's march into Pacalon!{W1}
=Oooh!{W1}
={LEADER}, we'll soon be reaching Pacalon, the country of centaurs.{W2}
=Over there you'll see a crowd of their splendid Knights!{W1}
=Oh no! Pacalon is under attack!{W1}
=If I'm not mistaken, that's the Devil Army!{N}{LEADER}, we must assist our allies.{W1}
=Master Magus!{N}Look over there! {LEADER} and his Force have arrived.{W1}
=Well, if we take the castle first, we can use it against {LEADER} and his soldiers!{W1}
=Ahh! It looks like our soldiers were defeated by {LEADER} yet again!{W1}
=We've got no choice.{N}Withdraw our troops and defeat {LEADER} first!{W1}
=*grunt*{N}How could this happen?{W1}
=Hehehe! What's wrong Magus?!{N}Did things not go according to plan?{W1}
=L...Lynx...?{N}Easy for you to say!{N}I'm only a step away from finishing them off.{W1}
=I find that most dubious, judging by the current situation.{W1}
=That's not fair!{W2}
=If they hadn't arrived so soon, I could have taken them as planned!{W1}
=It seems that they came here because they found you.{W1}
=Please, Lynx! I beg you to take me with you!{W1}

={LEADER}, the enemy has retreated!{W1}
=I'm Sylvia, a Knight from Pacalon.{W2}
=Thanks to you our country is safe and the Devil army has departed.{W1}
=You must be {LEADER}, right?{N}I know that because we received a report from Volcanon's country, Bedoe.{W1}
=I flew to Pacalon from Bedoe when I heard about the Devil Army.{W2}
=Not everyone can fly so far without a rest, wouldn't you agree? Ha ha ha!{W1}
=So, you were the one at Bedoe with Kiddo, fighting the Devil Army...{W1}
=Ah yes, I remember that.{W2}
=I also entered the cave, and just missed the cave-in.{W2}
=So, I quickly made it through one step ahead of you to Pacalon.{W1}
=Your actions have made me think...{W2}
=I'd like to come with you all and fight to protect our world.{W1}
=I hope I'm not too late, but I also wish to join you.{W1}
=Sylvia the Knight and Julia the Birdwoman join the Force.{W1}
=Before we go on to fight, we should all take a rest in Pacalon.{W1}
=Magus, we must report to you that this man has broken Army regulations!{W1}
=Now, if I remember correctly, you're Eric. That is your name, isn't it?{W2}
=I understand you used to be a spy...{W1}
=I didn't do anything of the sort!{W1}
=Ah, Magus, you always did enjoy blaming the innocent!{W1}
=Oh, it's you again.{N}You do me an injustice, Lynx. This time I have proof.{W1}
=Really?{W1}
=Then why don't you show me this 'proof'?{W2}
=What has Eric done? And what could Eric hope to achieve?{W1}
=All I want is to see Mishaela.{W2}
=If I enter the Devil Army, one of these days I'll meet up with her. So, that's the reason for my actions.{W1}
=Wh... what?!{W1}
=Well, well!{W1}
=You two! Get him and take him for execution!{W1}
=Wait. Isn't this interesting?{W1}
=Lynx, what do you plan to do?{W1}
=You caught him by using dirty traps. I cannot accept that.{W1}
=Eric is released from his chains.{W1}
=Fight me, Eric!{W2}
=If you cannot defeat me, you do not have a chance against Mistress Mishaela!{W1}
=I'm ready anytime... c'mon!{W1}
=Everyone else, step back and don't interfere!{W1}
=Oooh!{W1}
=*gasp*{W1}
=*gasp*{W1}
=Now's our chance! Everyone, after Eric!{W1}
=You can't do that!{N}I'm leaving this place now...{W1}
=After him!{W1}
=It's a shame we have to kill a man like him.{W1}
=I wanted to defeat that man in a fair battle.{W2}
=My apologies for causing you this trouble, Magus.{W2}
=But, remember this: you should always fight fair and square!{W1}
=Lynx is so selfish. One of these days I'll get even with him.{W1}
=First, I must find Eric, otherwise I'll be in big trouble!{W1}
=Volcanon said that we should head North.{W2}
=If we carry on this way, and don't go astray, we should reach the town of Moun.{W2}
=We'll have to go via Moun to get to the far north, where he said we'll find a real treat at a place called Nazca.{W1}
=It's about time our scout Julia reported back to us.{W1}
=Those guys seem to be wandering around quite strangely, don't they?{W2}
=It seems that Magus is the commanding officer of the Devil Army's force here, and they're quite frantic right now to find a guy called Eric...{W1}
= 
=Eric...{N}Interesting...{N}Who is that, I wonder?{W1}
=Any sign of Eric?{W1}
=No, he doesn't seem to be here.{W1}
=I don't know... he must be further away. We've gotta search well!{W1}
=Hey!{N}It's you guys again!{W1}
=Curses!{N}It seems like we'll have to fight them again!{W1}
=Hmm, did those guys make it this far to the north?{N}Put off the search for Eric, we must attack {LEADER} and his Force!{W1}
=We only just failed to catch Eric, and it's because we had to see to you first!{W2}
=And now we're disgraced! Uuggh, if Lynx hadn't gotten in my way...{W2}
={LEADER}, next time I'll do whatever it takes, remember that! Hehehe!{W1}
=Whatever it takes? What does he mean?{W2}
=Oh well, anyway...{N}As Sylvia said, we should head to the town of Moun now.{W1}
=...this is my battle plan, Lynx, and I need your assistance.{W1}
=What do you think you are doing?{N}I wanted a fairly matched battle.{W2}
=If you're going to have such unfair tactics, I can't go along with them. You need to rethink your plans, Magus.{W1}
=Hmmm.... unfair, you say?{W2}
=The only thing that matters in a battle is victory. I bet I can handle this without you anyway.{N}If you don't like the way I'm doing this, then go somewhere else.{W1}
=Are you serious, Magus?!{W2}
=Well, if you really mean it, it's not my turn anyway.{W1}
=Well, well, it's the Shining Force. I've heard rumours about you!{W1}
=You're early, we were just about to start preparing your welcome!{W1}
=Isn't the Devil Army here?{W1}
=No, the Devil Army already withdrew because they heard you were coming.{W1}
=They're bound to attack somewhere, don't you think?{W1}
=...please, won't you come into our town?{W1}
=This is a trap! Get out of there NOW!{W1}
=Hehehe, the fools actually came in!{W1}
=It's you!{W1}
=Yes it is I, Magus, commander of the Devil Army!{N}Take a look around, {LEADER}!{W1}
=You are completely surrounded.{N}Prepare to die... in the most humiliating way!{W1}
=Impossible! They defeated my troops again!{W2}
=I should have known that Lynx's absence was the fatal flaw in my plan.{W2}
=But remember this: you barely escaped with your lives!{W1}
=I should have known this was a trap...{W1}
=Hey, over here! Hurry up and open this gate!{W1}
=Thank goodness you're alright.{N}I didn't expect you to defeat the Devil Army under the circumstances.{W1}
=You're the one who Magus was pursuing?{W1}
=That's right, I'm Eric.{W1}
=I joined the Devil Army to see Mishaela. They discovered my real intentions, and took me before Magus. 
=So, why do you want to see Mishaela?{W1}
=My father, Elliot, worked for King Ramladu.{W2}
=But, the Devil Army manipulated the King, and made him a wicked man...{W1}
=My master, Max, told me of Elliot.{W2}
=He was a proud warrior.{W1}
=He knew the King was wrong, but he never betrayed his King.{W1}
=I see.{W1}
=But despite that, father should have fought against the Devil Army.{W2}
=I want to defeat the Devil Army. Please let me join you!{W1}
= 
=Since Moun and its people are safe and peaceful again, we should stay here and heal any injuries before we begin our journey.{W1}
= 
=This is simply disastrous Magus! Do you think your failure can be excused?!{W1}
=B....but if Lynx had followed my plan, it would have worked...{W1}
=...{W1}
=That's just an excuse, Magus, you poor excuse for a man!{W1}
=...next time I'll send my strongest unit to hunt them down and attack.{W1}
=If you fail to finish them next time, the consequences will be dire.{W1}
=This is getting serious. If you want, I can help you.{W1}
=*guffaws*{N}Excuse me?! You are the one who got me into this fix!{W1}
=I will not stoop so low as to use traps, even if it is by Mistress Mishaela's command.{W1}
= 
=Is that what you call chivalry?{N}Fine then! I won't ask you again.{W2}
=Lynx, get out of my sight immediately!{W1}
=If that's what you want...{W2}
=Magus, I wish you well in your war!{W1}
=Did he leave?{N}Finally!{N}That Mishaela too... only foul words come out of her mouth.{W1}
=Soon I, the great Magus, will show them how powerful I really am!{W2}
=I will lead my troops to great victory, dealing death with every blow!{N}*guffaws*{W1}
=This is the northernmost part of the Parmecian continent.{W2}
=Grans is already within our reach!{W1}
=This must be the place God Volcanon told us about.{W1}
=I've been waiting for you...{W1}
=It's you, Magus!{W1}
=So you've joined them, have you, Eric?{N}If so, all the more convenient for me!{W2}
=I must praise you for making it this far...{N}*guffaws*{W2}
=...but you've walked into my trap, and now I shall send you to your graves.{W1}
={LEADER}, I wouldn't put it past that guy to use foul play.{N}Please, be careful of his filthy trap!{W1}
={LEADER}, the enemy is coming!{W1}
=My elite team have been defeated.... th... those fools... Ugh!{W2}
=Perhaps those guys really are the Shining Force?{W2}
=Lynx, I beg you... please, capture my enemies!{N}Uuuggghhh...{W1}
=Magus... that terrible coward had it coming.{W2}
=But, we're not there yet {LEADER}. We still have to find Master Max!{W1}
=Well done, {LEADER}!{W1}
=Hmm? That's not God Volcanon's voice...{W1}
=I am Mitula.{N}Volcanon sends his heartfelt gratitude.{W2}
=I've been watching over you from my country, Tristan.{W1}
=Eric comes from Tristan, a country with a Goddess. Are you the Goddess he's talking about?{W1}
=Goddess Mitula?{W1}
=I, along with Volcanon, am also your ally!{W2}
={LEADER}, you must prevent the devil's revival, the time is approaching steadily.{W1}
=So you're Goddess Mitula. Tell me, what happened to Master Max?{W1}
=Max was defeated in a battle on Grans Island.{W1}
=What!{N}Master Max... defeated?!{W1}
=Then they disappeared.{N}I believe they are waiting for a chance to counterattack.{W2}
=Max must be waiting for you there.{W1}
=Master Max is waiting for us...{W1}
=Max's power is gone, you are now the forces of Light.{W1}
=We are the Shining Force...{W1}
=That's right!{N}{LEADER}, before you go on to search for Max, I must give you this, the Necklace of Light.{W1}
=According to legend, its radiance has been waiting for you!{W1}
=The Necklace of Light became attached to {LEADER}'s chest.{W1}
=You must go to Grans Island, I'll arrange for a magician from Tristan to go with you.{W2}
=I'm afraid to say, my powers are limited and are being obstructed, but I'll be praying for your safety.{W1}
=Even if this magician from Tristan joins us, we still don't know how we're going to get to Grans Island...{W1}
=Use the Nazca Ship!{W1}
=Nazca Ship?!{W1}
=The Ancients built it, a vehicle to fly in the air!{W1}
=I'm Minto, a magician from Mitula's country of Tristan.{W2}
=I came to explain to you the legend of the Nazca Ship.{W1}
=So, you're from Tristan...{N}But, what Nazca Ship? Where is it?!{W1}
=*giggles*{N}It's right here!{N}The very ground beneath us will fly, it is the ship.{W2}
=As your friend and ally, please allow me to come along with you.{W1}
=This is the entrance to the Nazca Ship. Please follow me!{W1}
=Minto placed a jewel, sparkling with light, on the ground.{W1}
=The Nazca Ship is ready to fly.{W1}
=Well, everyone, let's all get in!{W1}
={LEADER} and the Force are heading towards dark clouds as the Devil Army's plot for Grans Island develops...{W1}
=
={LEADER} and the others flew across to Grans Island in the Nazca Ship, a flying ship made by the Ancients.{W2}
=However, Grans is a savage land with monsters roaming free...{W1}
= 
=This is a very remote place...{W1}
=It seems quite rough, doesn't it? How uncivilized!{W2}
=I really don't understand what would make anyone want to come here!{W1}
=This mist is very thick, it's quite mysterious...{W1}
=I'd call it suspicious rather than mysterious.{W1}
=Mwahaha!{N}We've been eagerly awaiting your arrival!{W1}
=It seems as though the Devil Army has been lurking in the mist!{W1}
=Once our spies informed us that you were heading for Grans, we laid in wait for you.{W2}
=We thought you'd crawl by sometime...{N}Heh heh heh{N}...and it's just as we thought!{W2}
=Now it's time for us to defeat you in battle!{W1}
=Hohoho!{W1}
=Hoho, you are really good.{W1}
=W....who are you!{W1}
=I didn't just appear from nowhere! I'm Morton, and I've been training here.{W1}
=It was most impressive to see your perfect defeat of the Devil Army.{W2}
=That young man called Max is a very skillful warrior, but you are also good!{W1}
=Max?!{D2}{N}You know Master Max?{W2}
=Please, tell me more! Max is my master!{W1}
=Hohoho, is that so?{N}You're Max's companion?{W2}
=We made the rough crossing from Parmecia to Grans together, that's how we know each other.{W1}
=So, Max is here now?!{N}Please, let us see him!{W1}
=Unfortunately he's not here to see.{W2}
=I alone remain here, to continue my training and to find a waterfall which is rumoured to have supernatural powers.{W1}
=So then, Mr. Morton, you don't know where Max is?{W1}
=Unfortunately, that's the case.{N}I only know the way Max went...{W1}
=So, where was that?{W1}
=I'll remember in a minute... don't be impatient!{W1}
=Well, I've decided I should probably go with you.{W2}
=Even though I can't remember, it has been quite some time, and we should get going!{W1}
=We must help to get justice for our brave friend.{N}After all, what have I been doing all this training for?!{W1}
=Max has probably been taken to the devil's stronghold at Ground Seal's ancient tower.{W2}
=So, I assume that's where we'll be going too.{W1}
=The stronghold of Galam lies ahead of us. It was originally built to defend against monster attacks.{W2}
=We'll need to go through it.{W1}
=You say that's what it was for originally, but what has become of it now?{W1}
=It's now occupied by the Devil Army.{W2}
=Some say that only Eiku remains there, I think they are here for a purpose...{W1}
=?!{W1}
=I heard this from the people of Roft village.{W1}
=Roft village?{W1}
=Yes, the village is right ahead of us. We'll go there first, before we go to the fortress of Galam.{W1}
=They're here!{W2}
=It's those pathetic mortals who dare to defy the Devil Army!{W2}
=Although we are Master Eiku's scouting party, we alone are enough to take them down!{W1}
=Look over there! It's the Devil Army!{N}Looks like they found us.{W1}
=You're doing very well!{N}Since that's the case... tentacles, come out!{W1}
=Remember this... although you defeated us, you won't defeat Master Eiku in his fortress...{N}ugh...{W1}
={LEADER}, having heard those words, it seems Eiku's fortress may be a considerable thing to deal with today.{W2}
=Before we go on to fight, we should go and drop by the village of Roft.{W1}
=
=It seems that my scouting party met an untimely end.{W2}
=My order to avoid the battle and lure the enemy out must have been ignored.{W2}
=Since they defeated Magus, it's clear they are tough.{W1}
=They really are the Shining Force. No kidding.{W1}
=That's right, Eiku.{N}I suggest that you pay extra attention, and be well prepared before you face them.{W1}
=Lynx!{W1}
=Indeed.{N}How are your battle preparations progressing?{W1}
=What are you doing here!?{N}Magus died before your very eyes, and you didn't try to help him.{W2}
=If I was in the same situation, you wouldn't help me either. I will not allow this to happen.{W2}
=If those guys enter my fortress, they won't ever leave it!{W1}
=Eiku, are you saying that I allowed Magus to die?{W2}
=I suppose no matter what I say, it won't change your prejudice.{W2}
=I shouldn't have wasted my time worrying about you, Eiku.{N}Anyway, good luck. You must win.{W1}
=...is he gone?{W1}
=It looks like they've arrived.{W1}
=We're here to fell this fortress, isn't that right men?!{W1}
=Everyone, they are here! Now take them down!{N}I can already see our victory!{W1}
=Uooo!{W1}
=Mwahahaha!{N}Shining Force...{N}You've done well, according to the rumours.{W2}
=But you won't be able to progress beyond the fortress of the great Eiku!{W2}
=I shall take revenge for Magus, and you'll feel the pains of hell!{W1}
={LEADER}... what kind of trap has Eiku set for us?{W2}
=We don't know what it is, but we must advance.{N}We must go forward if we are to find Master Max.{W1}
={LEADER}, this is an eerie fortress, don't you agree?{W2}
=Those stone statues almost seem to be staring at us!{W1}
=Those statues mark your tombstones.{W1}
=You've done well to get this far, but now I'll stop you.{W2}
=You won't get your way, no matter what... and this place shall be your graveyard.{W1}
= 
=What are you talking about, Eiku?{N}We're going to get through your fortress and get to Master Max.{W1}
=Fwahahaha....{N}You're so stupid!{N}Max is already...{W2}
=Feh, I've said enough.{N}Enjoy yourselves in my terrible fortress!{W1}
=Now it's time for you to experience the true terror of this Fortress.{N}Awaken, stone statues!{W1}
=These fools...?{N}They can't have defeated me, the Great Eiku!{W2}
=They really must be the legendary Shining Force...{N}This really can't be happening.{W2}
=But, it's already too late for Max...{N}M... Mistress Mishaela... gufuu...{W1}
=Eiku...{N}He was a fearsome enemy.{W2}
=But, he started to say something about Master Max...{W2}
=What was he trying to tell us?{N}This doesn't bode well.{W1}
=Oohh...{N}Is everybody safe?{W1}
=That voice...{D1}{N}...could it be?!{W1}
=...Grandpa!{D1}{N}Is it really you?!{W1}
=I was worried this would never end...{D2}{N}...Cynthia.{W1}
=It's great that we've been reunited.{W2}
=...moreover it's good that our Elder is safe.{W1}
=Is that you, Adam?{W1}
=I've been confined in this Fortress.{W2}
=I saw a young man with his eyes closed defeat the guard soldier, helping me escape.{W1}
=A young man with closed eyes... who could it be..?{W2}
=Could there be someone else confronting the Devil Army, besides us?{W1}
=Companions, the shrine! There's no time to lose, we must go!{W2}
=If we don't hurry, the survivors of the Devil Army will break down the support pillars of this Fortress!{W2}
=The Fortress is collapsing... I think we have a problem!{W1}
=Indeed.{N}{LEADER}, make haste!{W1}
=You dwarves, hurry up!{N}Slaves have no right to take a break!{W1}
=Your eminence, we've received word that the enemy has escaped Eiku's Fortress and will be arriving here before long.{W2}
=I'm sorry to say that they were not crushed beneath the crumbling Fortress.{W1}
=So... they're already on their way here.{W2}
=This means Eiku must have performed pitifully.{W1}
=Well, the preparations here are almost finished. It seems we should be able to do this.{W2}
={LEADER}'s surprise appearance may be a good opportunity for us...{W1}
={LEADER}, we escaped the collapse of the Fortress by a hair's breadth, didn't we?!{W1}
=Ahh, of course the Devil Army are waiting for us here too.{W2}
=It also seems like they've caught some dwarves for slaves, eh?{W1}
=For some reason these young, weak dwarves are being used in this valley.{N}But what are they doing?{W2}
=I don't know, but I think we should be cautious in crossing this valley.{W1}
=Ah, over there - it's Mishaela.{W2}
={LEADER}, now's your chance to defeat Mishaela for sure!{W1}
=Experience the terror of the sandworms!{W1}
=Oouughh...{D2}{N}Misha... ugghh{W1}
=At last we've defeated Mishaela!{W2}
=Now all we have to do is find Master Max!{W1}
=It looks like the Devil Army rounded up the Dwarves from their isolated village, against their will, in order to build these things.{W1}
= 
=Thank you so much, everyone!{W2}
=It's such a relief that we can now return home by ourselves.{W1}
=Oh ho ho ho!{N}You think you've defeated me, but think again!{W1}
=Th... that voice!?{W1}
=Didn't you think that was a bit too easy, Adam?{W1}
=If that's the case...{N}Was the Mishaela we just defeated{D2} an impostor?{W1}
=Ho ho ho!{N}That was my other self, Mishaela Doll!{W2}
=Did you have fun with my cute little doll!?{W2}
=Thanks for letting me get on with Lord Darksol's revival meanwhile!{W1}
=!!!{N}So, that's what it was?{N}And, that's your goal, to revive Darksol?{W2}
=After Dark Dragon was defeated, we saw a shadow escape.{W2}
=That's why we've pursued you here.{W1}
=Our revival of Lord Darksol will be completed at Grans Island. Come and stop me if you can!{W2}
=He'll be fully revived before long.{N}Ho ho ho ho!{W2}
=However before that, please accept this token of my appreciation...{W1}
=Look out, Adam!{W1}
=Grandpa!{W1}
=A....Adam... is he safe? Cynthia...?{N}Ugh.... ughhhhhhh....{W1}
=Y...yes.{N}Grandpa...{D2}{N}Grandpa, hold on!{W1}
=Elder!{W1}
=Oh ho ho... in a little while our plans will be complete. Isn't that wonderful?! {W2}
=I'm going to enjoy defeating you the most!{N}Oh ho ho ho!{W1}
=Elder!{W1}
=I... I'm already dying.{N}Adam, somehow you have to save this world...{W1}
=Elder!{N}You must try to hold on!{W1}
=E...Eiku said that the Devil Army's stronghold is in Ground Seal, I'm certain of it.{W2}
=I'm counting on you, Adam.{N}{LEADER} and Ma... Ugh...{W1}
=...Elder...{N}How could such an true and innocent man be dragged into something like this?{W2}
=Mishaela...{N}I'll absolutely never forgive her for this!{W1}
=The Elder died before their very eyes.{W2}
=The unity of the Shining Force deepens as they hinder the plans of Mishaela and her Devil Army.{W1}
=
=The Shining Force tried to maintain high spirits while in the home town of the rescued dwarves.{W2}
=The Devil's revival is in nearby Ground Seal, which the Force are heading towards...{W1}
=After crossing this prairie, we'll reach the governmental City of Galam, the only city on Grans Island.{W1}
={LEADER}!{N}You escaped Magus and Eiku, now finally you're here.{W2}
=I must say I have a great respect for the Shining Force, but as I have just arrived, it's customary for me to make the first advance.{W1}
= 
=You are...!?{W1}
=My name is Lynx, and I'm the hard-working Commander of the Devil Army.{W2}
=I hold no grudge against you, it is my job to fight well and it's very important to me.{W2}
=Please, show me your strength.{W1}
=Lynx!{N}Are your helpers not fighting well enough?{W1}
=Mishaela! All this hindrance is unnecessary!{W2}
=I hope you're not planning to dishonour my battle.{W1}
=Oh ho ho, you never change, Lynx!{N}But in war, the only thing that matters is victory!{W2}
=So, I'll lend you a hand, Lynx.{N}Come out!{W1}
=So, the rumours of the Shining Force's strange powers were...{W2}
=If that's the case, perhaps it's possible that you're the only ones who really can defeat Mishaela.{W1}
=Sir Lynx...{W1}
=It's futile to have sympathy for one who's been defeated.{W2}
=It seems our group should hand over Ridion. Come out!{W1}
=Adam!!{W1}
=Ridion?! It can't be!{W1}
=Adam, at last we meet again!{W1}
=Uughh...{N}A..although Mishaela ordered me to finish him...{W2}
=..I will not kill a person who cannot fight anymore... {N}...uuughhh...{W1}
=S... Sir Lynx...{W1}
=Master Max and I were defeated in a battle with Sir Lynx.{W2}
=The fight was admirable - absolutely fair and square.{W1}
=So, what happened?{W1}
=After that we were taken to Mishaela's place.{W2}
=She gave Lynx an order for my death, and Master Max is currently still under Mishaela's supervision.{W1}
= 
=S... Sir Max is in Ground Seal's ancient tower.{W2}
=U... unfortunately both Darksol and his opposition, the Devil King Zeon, are both at that place.{W2}
=Evil power gathers there... and it seems soon they will be celebrating the use of this power!{W1}
=So, they're at the place where the Devil King Zeon is sealed away.{W2}
=And the evil power is going to be used for the revival of Darksol?{N}What a terrible situation!{W1}
=S...Sir Ridion, you have luck on your side.{D2}{N}U...uggghhhh...{N}...ughh...{W1}
=...Adam...{N}Let's go to the Ancient Tower and consign Darksol to oblivion.{W2}
=I may have been saved, but Sir Lynx and his exemplary conduct were not. Don't let his efforts go to waste.{W1}
=After defeating General Lynx, the Shining Force arrived at Galam city to request an audience with King Galam.{W1}
=
=What?!{N}You defeated the Devil Army's three Generals?!{W1}
=Yes, that's correct.{W1}
=Regrettably, we have a rather more shameful story to tell...{W2}
=Firstly, the Devil Army repeatedly confronted us too. Although we tried hard, we were eventually defeated.{W1}
= 
=So that's what happened, eh?{W1}
=Now, all my soldiers have been sent out, we have no more soldiers to stand against them.{W2}
=We'll be forced to sit back and watch as the Devil is revived at the Ancient Tower.{W2}
=But since you defeated the three Generals, maybe you'll be able to stop them...{W1}
=Ah, here you are, Shining Force!{W2}
=I thought you'd want to hide.{N}But, I guessed you might want to talk with King Galam, so here we are.{W2}
=...we need to have a private talk with King Galam, then we'll kill you.{W1}
=King Galam has betrayed us!{N}You'll pay for this with your lives!{W1}
=We'll fight right here, and you'll not be leaving!{W1}
=That's what HE says, but he's wrong!{W1}
=You have demonstrated great skill in your fighting technique.{W2}
=With such skill, surely you can defeat the Devil Army!{W2}
=Though I do not know if it will be of use to you, I can offer you a sword.{N}Someone bring it to me!{W1}
=Your Highness!{N}Is this the one?{W1}
=It is indeed!{W1}
=We confiscated this sword from a man in the Devil Army.{W2}
=When doing so, the Devil Army sent for me...{W1}
=Aah!{N}This is, unmistakably, Master Max's sword!{W2}
=Your Highness, has Master Max been through here?{W1}
=Oh, him?{N}He certainly has!{W1}
=Excellent!{N}Master Max has been here!{W1}
={LEADER}, this sword possesses the Powers of Light. It's a very important sword.{W2}
=So, please accept it from His Highness.{W1}
={LEADER} received the Chaos Breaker!{W1}
=Well then, everyone!{W2}
=Before you face the final battles, it would be best for you to rest in town awhile.{W1}
=According to King Galam, evil powers gather ahead of here, at Ground Seal.{W2}
=Master Max is captive in the ancient tower, opposite the rocky mountains over there.{W2}
=...{LEADER}, I'm worried about Master Max. We must make haste!{W1}
=Ah, what a simply magnificent view!{N}First, I'd recommend that you think carefully before you do anything, wouldn't you agree?{W1}
=That voice... it's Mishaela!{W1}
=We were praised as the 'Shining Force' in Galam, and it would seem that our reputation precedes us.{W2}
=We've made it this far...{W2}
=...but let's see what awaits us at this prairie.{W1}
=There are a great number of strange orbs on the prairie. What could their purpose be?{W1}
=Oh ho ho!{N}You'd do well to recognise their powers.{W1}
=Ah, our enemy on the prairie is just one of Mishaela's dolls.{W2}
=This is doubtless another trap set by Mishaela - no different than before.{N}Be careful, {LEADER}!{W1}
=It can't be...{N}Because of those Orbs, our magical powers were continually restored!{W2}
=It's no wonder everyone in the Devil Army used magic. That was the reason!{W2}
=Well, it's time we went to find Master Max and stop the Devil's revival!{W1}
=Oh ho ho ho... your battles thus far have been most admirable, {LEADER}.{W2}
=This time, Shining Force, I think your capabilities are really going to be put to the test!{W2}
=As such, I've carefully prepared a rather interesting plan for you.{W1}
=Come out, Mishaela!{N}You're acting like a coward, as usual. Do you intend to fight us or not?!{W1}
=Oh ho ho, you're certainly strong, I'll admit that much, however...{W2}
=You'll be no match for him!{W1}
=There's nothing {LEADER} and the rest of us fear.{W1}
=*guffaws*{N}Adam, this man would be heartbroken if he heard you talking about him that way.{W1}
=What do you mean?{W1}
=I wonder if he's fully recovered yet? I assume so...{W2}
=You used to rely on this man!{N}Well, come out!{W1}
=That swordsman's mask....{W1}
=Because of the mask he wears, he's been given the powers of darkness, and become a member of the Devil Army.{W2}
=By doing this, he's joined his older brother Kane, hasn't he?!{W2}
=Oh ho ho ho!{N}I think this fight's going to be most enjoyable!{W1}
=Wha... what's this all about?!!{W1}
=You have to try to defeat Max!{W2}
=Well, Max... take them out!{W1}
=It looks like we'll have to fight Master Max...{W2}
=Master Max, please wait!{N}We'll solve this curse, you'll see!{W1}
=Master Max!{W1}
=Adam tried to remove Max's mask...{W2}
=...but the mask did not come off.{W1}
=That's the Mask of Darkness. You can't remove it, unless you're a Devil.{W1}
=Who are you?{W1}
=I am Odd Eye, but I don't know if that's a good thing for you.{W2}
=Now I'll remove the mask that covers his face, myself.{W2}
=This mask is protected by the Powers of Darkness, but it's possible for a Devil to remove it.{W1}
=I'll give it a try...{W1}
=Uuggh....{W1}
=Waaaaaa!{W1}
=The Mask of Darkness that covered Max's face, shattered into tiny pieces.{W1}
=It seems as if I've been able to help him.{N}So, I shall leave.{W1}
=Please wait a minute!{N}You said the Mask of Darkness could only be removed by a Devil...{W2}
=That means you're a Devil. So, why did you help Master Max?{W1}
=I am indeed a Devil...{N}My master is Zeon, the King of the Devils.{W2}
=Long ago, my master Zeon was ensnared and sealed beneath the ground.{W2}
=Darksol is your enemy, and he's my enemy too.{W1}
=...{W1}
=I want him defeated. That's my only purpose.{W2}
=Feh, I talk too much.{N}Farewell then.{W1}
=Perhaps it was you who helped the Elder to escape from Eiku's fortress...{W1}
=Are you sure you want to suspend the game?
={LEADER}, are you prepared to depart for battle?{D3}
=Do you need to make any other preparations?
=Why not try some different skills?{W2}
=So, it's time to relight the embers?{D1}{N}The impossible lies ahead...{D1}
={LEADER}, don't overwork yourself, the worst is yet to come.{N}Why not relax a while and work on your strategy?{D3}

=.....{W1}
=Together, we'll defeat the Devil Army!{W2}{N}I'll battle at your side again, but I do miss my wife...{N}...no, really!{W1}
=As an honourable knight, I will fight with all my strength until I can fight no more.{N}I won't let you down!{W1}
=You're replacing me right before a battle?{N}Modesty aside, I thought I was a valuable member of the team!{W1}
=Is the battle starting? I didn't think I was going to be in it...{N}Don't you think Mead would be a better choice?{W1}
=I think you'll find my magical skills and intellect helpful!{N}I'll continue my studies and practice during my time away from battle.{W1}
=Now I've practiced some more, I'll amaze you with my problem-solving abilities and combat skills!{W1}
=Eh? I'm being taken out of battle?{N}Paige might've said I was sleepy, but that's not true!{W1}
=Somebody is leaving the battle?{N}With my healing skills and fighting style, I'll make sure we all stay alive!{W1}
=My bow could do with a few repairs, if you'll excuse me.{N}Is it alright if I practice my aim too?{W1}
=I can provide support from behind the front line.{N}From there, I can shoot down any enemies from a distance!{W1}
=So, I'm to join the others in HQ...{N}While there, I will pray for our wellbeing!{W1}
=If someone's injured, count on me!{N}I'll give them treatment quickly.{N}Isn't that good to know?!{W1}
=You're swapping me out?{N}Hmmm... I do hope my usefulness hasn't run out!{W1}
=Just as I thought!{N}As a professional thief and fighter, I am like the immortal Doji in battle.{N}Whatever happens, you can depend on me!{W1}

=Just you watch me attack from the sky!{N}I'll give the masters of the Devil Army a good punch!{W1}
=I stand here in service of you all...{N}Now I'm  not needed on the battlefield, I'll spend some time honing my skills at HQ.{W1}
=For my homeland of Pacalon, I'll fight with all the strength I have!{W1}
=I'm being removed?{N}I regret that I will not be there at the start of the next battle.{W1}

=My only desire is to fight the Devil Army and defeat Mishaela!{N}But, those are my personal feelings.{N}Those aside, I shall at least protect everyone here!{W1}
=For my father Elliot, and for the good of the world I would give my life in battle!{W1}
=Goddess Mitula is surely watching over and protecting us... please, don't leave me behind!{W1}
=Goddess Mitula, as I go out to battle, I humbly ask for the gift of your divine protection!{W1}
=Aaaah...{N}I've survived the battle thus far!{N}If you're asking me to take a rest, I won't complain.{W1}
=It's time to see how successful my training proves in real combat!{N}You'll see only the best from me!{W1}
=A shinobi will never reveal his secrets...{W2}{N}...however, you may call upon my powers any time that you need them.{W1}
=A shinibi's destiny is to live in the shadows...{N}...but at this time there is an important cause for which I must fight!{W1}
=I appreciate you rescuing me, but I don't understand why you did if I'm not to be part of the fighting group...{W1}
=Alright - time to battle!{W2}{N}I only hope I can be as chivalrous as Lynx on the battlefield.{W1}
=Sometimes, the best strategy is to retreat!{N}It's also important to know your own limits, and not overstretch yourself.{W1}
=The samurai code of chivalry demands that I risk my life for the cause of justice.{N}I will aid you in your fight!{W1}
=Although I'll not be fighting with you, I know you'll never see defeat with such solid tactics!{N}Do your best!{W1}

=As you say, Ruburan, this is indeed a dangerous journey.{N}However we have no choice but to go.{W2}
=Your men are in danger too. We can't just stand by and do nothing.{N}Please lead the way, Ruburan.{W1}
=...{D2}{N}Alright then, everybody follow me!{W1}
=This place is dangerous... it's crawling with monsters.{W2}
=They outnumber us by far... we should make this quick then hurry to my secret hideout.{W1}
={LEADER}, as Ruburan said, let's make haste.{W1}
=Hehehe!{N}It looks like our victims have arrived!{W2}
=Capture them all!{W1}
=Heh.{N}I absolutely hate these guys!{N}This could be dangerous...{W1}
=That was easy, wasn't it?! You all put up a great fight!{N}Any interest in becoming bandits? You'll be welcomed in my gang.{W1}
=Oh, look over there - a camp! What a relief! I suppose we should go there.{W1}
={LEADER}, let's hurry to the camp.{W1}
=Wait, {LEADER}!{N}I want to come with you!{W1}
=I.... I couldn't just stay back there doing nothing. I was so worried about Grandpa.{W2}
=In spite of what you said, I've decided I have to come with you all.{W1}
=What?! You followed us here?{N}You're just a little girl! Now go home before you get hurt.{W1}
=What you said makes sense, Ruburan. But, it's too dangerous for Cynthia to go back by herself.{W1}
=I don't think I can help much in fighting, but I can use healing magic.{W2}
=If anyone is injured, I can heal them!{W1}
=Well {LEADER}, what do you think? Should we let her accompany us?{W1}
={LEADER} gently nods his head.{W1}
=Thank you! Well then, let's hurry to Ribble Camp.{W2}
=I'm sure we'll be welcome, because a lot of people there are from Hassan too.{W1}
=Once we cross this bridge, we can get to my secret hideout. I'll lead the way again.{W1}
=Well, everyone - quickly, follow me across!{W1}
=What?!!{N}What in the world is that?{N}Something's happening!{W1}
=Ruburan, this looks dangerous.{N}Hurry! The bridge is starting to shake!{W1}
=The rumours at Ribble Camp must be true, that's the Kraken!{W1}
=It looks like we'll have some difficulty before we can cross the bridge and continue our journey.{W2}
={LEADER}, here you must show your strength as a Hero. Defeat it so that we can get across!{W1}
=You did well, {LEADER}.{W2}
=Let's get to the other side while the Kraken is not attacking.{W1}
=Hurry everyone, the bridge is falling apart!{N}The Kraken is no longer our immediate concern, we must get across!
=Hey, boss!!{W1}
=Ruburan, you've got yourself in quite a lot of trouble!{W2}
=Just a moment...{W1}
=I'll get the Kraken off your back!{W1}
=Nosshu used something to release a foul smell. The Kraken can't stand it, and retreats.{W1}
=Well, we made it through that one okay!{W1}
=Oh! The bridge...{W2}
=The bridge is falling away!{W1}
=It seems there's only one way forward for us now.{W1}
=Chief Ruburan, we've been waiting eagerly for your return!{W1}
=Nosshu, you got away!{N}What about the others?{W1}
=It's serious boss! I somehow managed to escape in the panic and confusion!{W2}
=When that woman came back, we knew it meant trouble.{W1}
='That woman'? I think you mean Mishaela.{W1}
=Indeed. We can't waste any more time here.{D2}{N}Let's hurry to my secret base!{W1}
=I'm sorry to say that your dear chief Ruburan is in enemy hands.{W2}
=Why not consider co-operating with me?{W2}
=It's the only way to save you all.{W1}
=Is... is that true?{W1}
=It's true.{W2}
=I don't think you follow that scoundrel of your own free will anyway. Wouldn't it be better for you to work with the Devil Army?{W2}
=Once we are allies, our first mission will be to defeat Volcanon.{W1}
=Volcanon...!{N}Just a minute...{W2}
=Volcanon, isn't he the god that protects this continent?{W1}
=That woman is one of the devils?{W2}
=I didn't know we were aiding such a great evil. This is no laughing matter.{W2}
=We might not exactly have been good guys, but we're not evil backstabbers either!{W1}
=Wait right there Mishaela!{W1}
=Well, well, well... you're back, Ruburan!{N}You didn't come out just to oppose my words, did you?{W1}
=Minion of evil, your words are irrelevant.{W2}
=You tried to enslave us with sweet talk...
=I will no longer tolerate that!{W1}
=I offered to help you. Is this how you repay my generosity?{W2}
=I'm sure you know that there will be consequences for your defiance!{W1}
=Curse you!{D2}{N}I can't move!{W1}
=Ah yes, that reminds me!{N}Since you want to die so eagerly, I'll give you a farewell present.{W1}
=You can stay there and watch while your henchmen burn in a living hell!{W1}
=Wait Mishaela...{W1}
=Aha!{N}So, there are yet more of you hiding over there, besides the rat!{W2}
=But, I can't be bothered to wait for you to come out, I'm a busy woman you know...{W1}
=So, I'll brighten this place up with a Spark Level 3!{W1}
=You over there! Finish those peeping rats.{W2}
=I'll leave first. It's time for me to face that troublesome Volcanon... and defeat him!{W1}
=Now, Lynx...{W1}
=Yes, ma'am?{W1}
=As planned, you should go to Max.{W1}
=Right!{W1}
=As for you there... finish them all.{N}Do not fail me.{W1}
=If you think this all of us, you are gravely mistaken!{W1}
=Curses!{N}If I weren't such a fool, my henchmen wouldn't be...{W1}
=Chief Ruburan, I'm sorry...{N}We were afraid... so afraid. We couldn't fight!{W1}
=It's okay, Nosshu. That woman sends a chill down my spine too!{W2}
=Nevertheless, I cannot forgive her for this.{W1}
=Those devils use their power to toy with the world. I will not allow them to do whatever they like.{W2}
={LEADER}, for this reason, I'd like to come along with you.{W1}
=Chief, I'd like to come along with you too!{W1}
=No, Nosshu - you need to stay here and protect our hideout.{W1}
= 
=Right, chief!{W1}
=Well, let's go!{W1}
=Stay here, Nosshu, and...{W2}
=... await my glorious return!{W1}
=Chiiieeeefff!!{W1}
=Nosshu...{D2}{N}...{W1}
=Come on, {LEADER}. We should leave now.{W1}
=Hey, Mishaela's over there!!{W1}
=These birds are bothersome, aren't they? We can't focus like this. {W1}
=Go and get rid of them!{W1}
=I won't let you have your way!{W1}
=Ah, good job!{W2}
=Now's our chance to seal away Volcanon's power!{W1}
=Ooooh!{D2}{N}Shaaaa!{W1}
=Oh, ho ho ho!{W2}
=Volcanon's power has been sealed away!{W1}
=That took care of another hindrance to our plan!{N}Oh ho ho ho!{W2}
=I must return to Grans Island to make preparations. You stay here in case Volcanon tries anything.{W1}
=Mishaela's escaped!{N}Quickly {LEADER}, after her!{W1}
=If you want to pass through here, you'll have to get past us first!{W1}
=It seems we've been discovered.{N}We have no choice but to defeat them, if we're to progress.{W1}
=My thanks to you, {LEADER} and your Force.{W1}
=Who are you?{W1}
=I am Volcanon.{W1}
=You're Volcanon...{N}But how did you know {LEADER}'s name?{W1}
=I've been watching the Devil Army's movements regularly.{W2}
=On one occasion they appeared, and {LEADER} was there with Max.{W1}
=I see.{W1}
=I am concerned that the Devil Army has a treacherous plan involving Grans Island. Their ambition will bring panic to all the creatures of these lands.{W2}
=But their evil has already engulfed Grans Island, hence I cannot lay my hands on them.{W1}
=So... What should we do?{W1}
=You and your companions should go to Grans Island, and try to find a solution to this.{W2}
=Max is there too, it's important that you find a way to help him.{W1}
=Going to Grans Island... is that all we have to do?{W1}
=If that's the case, I'd like to come along too.{W1}
=Didn't we see you earlier...?{W1}
=Teehee! We didn't succeed earlier because we weren't prepared for such trouble.{W2}
=But I know I'll be a real asset to your team, because I can fly.{W1}
=What do you think, God Volcanon? Don't you think it's a good idea to let me go too?{W1}
=Hmm...{N}Indeed. {LEADER} has no flying allies in his party.{W1}
=Yay! Well then, please allow me to fight the Devil Army at your side. We'll fight for peace together!{W1}
=By the way, God Volcanon, how are we going to get to Grans Island?{W1}
=North, head north.{N}Head north and your path will open before you.{W1}
=This cave will begin the next stage of your journey. I will always be watching over you, {LEADER}!{W1}
=With God Volcanon's advice in mind, {LEADER} and the others must now travel to Grans Island.{W2}
=However, this is only the beginning!{W1}
=Step by step and day by day, {LEADER} and his Force draw nearer to Grans Island.{W2}
=However, following their unexpected escape, Mishaela is waiting for their arrival...{W1}
=Lynx, how are the plans to capture Max progressing?{W1}
=They're going well. If they continue as planned, we will soon have Max.{W1}
=Excellent.{N}By the way, Eiku, what became of {LEADER} and his party?{W1}
=Well... I've been informed that they were able to defeat your guards and after they reached Bedoe, Volcanon appeared to them.{W2}
=
=They have not been seen since then.{N}Magus has begun a search for them.{W1}
=So, Magus!{W1}
=Is everything going to be alright?{W1}
=Hehehe! Don't worry.{W2}
=If by any chance they should get through Pacalon, they won't survive the cunning trap I have prepared!{W1}
=Good.{N}You should go to Pacalon immediately!{W1}
=Hehehe...{N}I will... hehehe.{W1}
=By the way, what purpose will the old man from Hassan serve?{W1}
=Well, we have to let him live for now.{N}Primarily, it's about {LEADER}. Secondly, he may be withholding important information from us.{W2}
=The old man is a precious source for knowledge of the ancient relic.{W2}
=However...{W1}
=If, by any chance, {LEADER} is really the child of that man...{W2}
=I thought Max was the only enemy we would have to worry about.{W1}
=Personally, I'm delighted at the opportunity to face such a powerful enemy.{W1}
=Eiku!{N}He is not your enemy... at least, not for now.{W1}
=But, if I defeat him first, Eiku won't have a chance, hehehe!{W1}
=What are you saying, Lynx?!{N}Are you implying that I'm not able to defeat {LEADER}?!{W1}
=*guffaws*{N}Did I make it too obvious?{W2}
=Oh well. What you choose to do about it is your own business.{W1}
=Enough, Lynx. Don't you have task called 'capturing Max' already?!{W1}
=Yes, m'lady! Please excuse me.{W1}
=Magus should be able to defeat {LEADER} and his team without any problems, but it's your job to make sure Eiku. If he fails then it's your turn.{W1}
= 
=You can trust me with this task.{N}I'll bring him down, that's for sure! Just you watch me!{W1}
=Ho ho ho, Eiku!{N}Those are very promising words indeed! {W1}
={LEADER}, you're really going to have to try your best, because we're watching you!{N}Oh ho ho ho!{W1}
=A.... Adam...{W1}
=I didn't expect the new Shining Force to become so dependable!{W1}
=Master Max...{W2}
={LEADER} has guided us so far.{W1}
=So, it was you...{W2}
=I'm ashamed to say they put that mask on me when I was defeated in a fight with Lynx.{W2}
=Curses! It can't be that I had the same fate as my brother, Kane!{N}At least we've put an end to it now.{W1}
=How could this happen to both Max and Kane...{W1}
=...nevertheless, you've skilfully made it this far.{W2}
=I was afraid, but thanks to you it seems like we'll be able to go home.{W1}
=With that much power, {LEADER}, perhaps we really can stop the Devil's revival.{W2}
={LEADER}, may I too join the new Shining Force?{W1}
=That will reassure the group, {LEADER}.{N}Well, we should make haste and move on.{W1}
=This is the place of Lord Darksol's revival...{W1}
=Soon his revival will be completed.{W2}
=At that time, anyone who stands in his way will be powerless against him!{W2}
=Until then, {LEADER} and his force must not be allowed anywhere near Lord Darksol.{W1}
=Mistress Mishaela, even if Max is defeated, those guys pose no threat for you.{W1}
= 
=Well, I won't be defeated!{W2}
=But, I think {LEADER} will give us more trouble than Max did.{W2}
=If by some chance they make it here, you must fight with all your strength!{W1}
={LEADER} being more troublesome than Max...?{W1}
=You should not take {LEADER} so lightly. He's a talented man, and will require extra attention when we deal with him...{W1}
=Don't think you know {LEADER} so well, Mishaela!{W1}
=It can't be...!{N}How did those guys get here?!{W1}
=Thanks to {LEADER}, I've been able to return to my old self.{W2}
=I'm sure you don't see how sweet {LEADER} is!{W1}
=*guffaws*{N}Well, well, well... isn't this a surprise?!{N}It seems there's something you don't know about {LEADER} yet, Max.{W2}
=20 years ago a prophet in Manarina gave your brother Kane a prediction...{W1}
=What?!{W1}
=That prediction spoke of our reviving Lord Darksol, at this very place.{W2}
=Kane didn't like the thought of that. He had a son, and sent him away to defeat Lord Darksol.{W2}
=...{D1}{N}and that son was...{D2} {LEADER}!{W1}
=What the...?!{W1}
=Kane raised his son to lead a Shining Force, just like you - his brother - led the Shining Force.{W2}
=His son was to follow in your footsteps.{W1}
={LEADER}, you...{W2}
=...are my older brother's son?!{W1}
=I found out about this through Hassan's Elder, and I was surprised too!{W2}
=Such a thing just can't be, can it?!{W1}
=Lord Darksol's revival is almost complete! Oh ho ho ho!{W2}
=This time, without a doubt, you fools shall not hinder the realisation of our great dream!{W1}
= 
=Mishaela, you can't do that!{W2}
=I can't allow you to use Lord Zeon's power in the revival of Darksol.{W1}
=W... who's that?!{W1}
=Y... you're Odd Eye!{W2}
=You're a devil, just like me. How could you have sided with those guys?{W2}
=You can try to hinder us all you like, but it will do no good.{N}I'll risk my life to see Lord Darksol revive completely!{W1}
=Mishaela, you need to wake up!{N}Why are you going so far?{W2}
=You're just dazzled by Darksol's illusions.{W2}
=You're putting your life on the line here... will that do you any good?!{W1}
=We must protect Lord Darksol's dear child, Mephisto!{W2}
=Compared with that goal, my life isn't important.{W1}
={LEADER}! If it's like this, one man alone cannot defeat Mishaela.{W2}
=Darksol's revival must be stopped! I'll join your party.{W1}
=Odd Eye the Devil has joined the Force.{W1}
=It seems I've been defeated, my magical powers are exhausted...{W2}
=I must cast away this life for...{D2}{N}At least...{W2}
=I'll sacrifice myself for you, Lord Darksol!{W1}
=Mishaela sacrificed her life for Darksol's revival...{W1}
=Mishaela's life has completed the revival of my powers.{W2}
=Now, take a good look at the true form of Darksol, King of the Devils!{W1}
=L...look over there everyone! Darksol seems to have completed his revival.{W2}
=Prepare yourselves to defeat him!{W1}
=It can't be!{N}Mere mortals can't have defeated me like this!{W2}
=My revival should have been completed...{N}How...?{W2}
=Something has been holding back my powers, but what...?{W1}
=Darksol, the completion of your revival was hindered by the one you personally sealed away...{W2}
=the Devil King, Zeon!{W1}
=Ah, I can hear the voice of Goddess Mitula...{W1}
=ZEON!!{N}Is that you sealing my powers from deep below?!{W1}
=Now, {LEADER}! Throw the necklace at Darksol!{W1}
=Ugyaa.....!{W1}
=Darksol falls into the abyss...{W1}
=All members have revived!{W1}
=At last, Darksol is...{W1}
={LEADER}, we defeated him!{W1}
=Master Max, I... I...{W1}
=Adam wants to cry!{W1}
=Hohoho! Finally, the devil has been defeated!{W1}
=First of all, I must express my gratitude to you.{W2}
=But the next time we meet, we are destined to fight, because I am a Devil...{W1}
=Odd Eye...{W1}
=We must never forget what happened here, not ever... ever...{W1}
=Ah, the sun is rising!{W1}
=So it is...{W1}
=...and so that's what happened, King Galam.{W1}
=Splendid work, most admirable!{W2}
=You really are the Shining Force!{W1}
=But, Darkol's powers are still present in this world.{W2}
=He's not dead... and his revival must be prevented.{W2}
=So, {LEADER} left this sword, because its powers could offer some protection.{W1}
=King Galam received the Chaos Breaker.{W1}
=This is the ancient sword that Max wielded, and that I awarded you recently, is it not?{W1}
= 
=That's correct, your Majesty.{N}This sword possesses the Powers of Light.{W2}
=Please use its powers to protect against the devils' revival.{W1}
=I understand completely.{N}So, how about this?{W2}
=Since it's said that Zeon is sealed there too, we'll place this sword in the shrine.{W2}
=Because it possesses the protective Powers of Light, I expect it will supply extra protective strength.{W1}
=Many thanks, your Majesty.{W1}
=So, after this the sword will be placed in the ancient shrine.{W2}
=The sword will be renamed to 'Force Blade', in honour of all you've done.{N}It's a good idea, don't you think?{W1}
=The 'Force Blade'?{N}Thank you, your Majesty, this is indeed a very happy occasion.{W1}
=And now, my children, have you decided on a person to work together with Galam in protecting the Ground Seal?{W1}
= 
=Yes, we all agreed that this matter should be decided by Ruburan.{W1}
=This man is to become the King of Ground Seal.{W2}
=He's a more patient man than I, and far more suitable.{N}Allow me to introduce him!{W1}
=Nosshu is honest... and what strength!{W2}
=I mean, he travelled all the way here by himself.{W2}
=He'll certainly become a great King, don't you agree, King Galam?{W1}
=B....but, Boss, I'm useless compared with you...{W1}
=Everyone has recommended that I make the decision, and I choose you, Nosshu.{W2}
=I don't expect anyone would disagree that you'll make a good King, isn't that right?{W1}
=Well, if it's the decision of the Shining Force, then who am I to refuse it?{W1}
= 
=Yahoo!{N}It's decided, it's decided!{N}Nosshu will be the King!{W1}
=Isn't it great, Nosshu?!{W2}
=If you hadn't shown up when we faced the Kraken, I don't know what we would have done.{W2}
=Nosshu... you'll really become a good King.{W1}
=...Y... yes, boss!{W1}
=Nosshu, congratulations on being the founder of Ground Seal!{W2}
=If you need help, I'll be here for you.{W1}
=Huh?!{W1}
=There are many things I'd like to look into, following our victory over the terrible crisis.{W2}
=The existence of devils and the seals... the purpose of Light.{W2}
=I'd like to investigate the value of some of these phenomenon, there's a lot to learn!{W1}
=Ah, once again we see the scholar's curiosity in Hawel!{W2}
=Hawel, do your best!{N}Together with Nosshu you'll make a magnificent country.{W1}
=Uh-huh, Sonette, I'll do my best!{W1}
=Good....{D1} but everyone must try their hardest now that {LEADER}, Max and Adam aren't here anymore.{W2}
=Where did those guys go, anyway?{W1}
=You're right... where did they all go?{W1}
=Even Odd Eye fought alongside us.{W2}
=Everyone joined together, and for the first time we really were the Shining Force...{W1}
=But, I think I can understand more or less how {LEADER} and the others must be feeling.{W2}
=As a man, I feel that now is the time for my own preparations... I want to travel too!{W1}
=What?! Knuckles, you'd just sleep in late while everyone else left without you...{W1}
= 
=I, for one, am sure they'll come back to us someday.{W2}
=Someday, without a doubt...{W1}
=Mephisto, this is the place where your parents sleep.{W2}
=Take a good look at it, and remember it well...{W1}
=Waaah waaaah!{W1}
=There, there now, Mephisto. Don't cry.{W2}
=Well, Mephisto... we must go quietly to the place where our comrades wait.{W1}
0795=He had better stay.{N}Say farewell.{W1}
0796=It was great travelling with{N}you {LEADER}.{W2}
0797=Thank you.  Please be{N}careful.{W1}
0798={LEADER}, you'll learn{N}the reason why he has to stay{N}here soon enough.{W2}
0799=Don't think about it now.{N}Go to the north.{W1}
079A=We devils can't help you.{W2}
079B=People of the Earth have{N}to seal Zeon again by{N}themselves.{W1}
079C=Hello, {LEADER}.{N}How are you?{W2}
079D=I'm well...but, I've had a{N}bad headache lately.{W1}
079E=Is he getting back his{N}memory yet?{W2}
079F=He's suffering from a very{N}bad headache.{W1}
07A0=(Sob, sob){N}(Sob, sob){N}Oh, {LEADER}!{W2}
07A1=Oddler regained his memory{N}and suddenly went berserk.{W2}
07A2=He had a fearful face,{N}but my master seemed to{N}understand everything.{W2}
07A3=He fell into the sea to stop{N}Oddler.{N}Is Mr. Creed still alive?{W1}
07A4=Ketto is on the southern{N}edge of North Parmecia.{W1}
07A5=Where did you come from,{N}boy?{W2}
07A6=From South Parmecia?{N}Really?{W2}
07A7=The tunnel to the south is{N}blocked.{W1}
07A8=From South Parmecia?{N}Why did you come here?{W2}
07A9=Pacalon has become isolated{N}since we opposed the devils.{W2}
07AA=If I were you, I'd leave.{W1}
07AB=It's unusually hot!{W2}
07AC=Is Mitula as sick as I've{N}heard?{W1}
07AD=The devils forbade us to go{N}out. {W1}
07AE=Blast!  I hate devils....{W1}
07AF=Ah, are you a customer?{N}Wow!{W2}
07B0=It's a secret, OK?{N}I have very good weapons.{N}Hee, hee.{W2}
07B1=Do you want to buy one?{N}Oh, you do?!  OK, come to my{N}shop!{W1}
07B2=I'm a priest.{W2}
07B3=Sorry, I can't open my{N}church for you.{N}Please understand.{W1}
07B4=Hey, listen to me.{W1}
07B5=Pacalon was always a good{N}customer for us!{N}They bought a lot!{W2}
07B6=But, now we can't sell our{N}weapons because of the{N}devils!{W2}
07B7=Annoying devils!{W1}
07B8=Oh, sorry.{W2}
07B9=I don't want to bother you.{W1}
07BA=You again?{N}Bye now.{W1}
07BB=Tristan is ruled by the{N}Goddess Mitula.{W2}
07BC=So, we have no king.{W1}
07BD=Devils?  They'd better not{N}come to Parmecia...{W2}
07BE=as long as Mitula and{N}Volcanon are watching!{W1}
07BF=I've not seen her here, but{N}she is in the shrine.{W2}
07C0=Mitula Shrine is behind the{N}caverns of Tristan.{W1}
07C1=Storytellers in the shrine{N}tell us the legends of the{N}world.{W2}
07C2=Sometimes, it's difficult for{N}us to understand their true{N}meanings.{W1}
07C3=It hasn't rained here lately?{N}No kidding!{W2}
07C4=Everything is OK, as long as{N}Mitula is here.{W1}
07C5=Oh, you're from South{N}Parmecia?  Welcome!{W2}
07C6=The longer you stay, the more{N}you'll like it here!{W1}
07C7=Hey, what happened here?{W2}

0890=Astral glares at {LEADER}.{W1}

0927=How did you get past the{N}Galam guards?{W1}
0928=No one is allowed to leave{N}'til we conquer Granseal!{W1}
0929=I know...ah...but...{N}King Galam...left this{N}behind.{W1}
092A=And you want to bring it to{N}him?  Hmmmm.  I don't know....{W1}
092B=What's going on here?{W1}
092C=They want to deliver a{N}package to the King.{W1}
092D=To King Galam?  It sounds{N}important.{W2}
092E=But he has not rescinded{N}his orders yet....{N}I had better deliver it.{W1}
092F=I'll get the package from{N}them.{W1}
0930=I think we're in trouble!{W1}
0931=Hand it over.{N}I'll deliver it to...?{N}You!!!{W1}
0932=How did you escape from{N}jail?!{W1}
0933=Hey, these are the Granseal{N}spies!{W1}
0934=Oops!  That didn't work!{W1}

093F=I'll kill you before they{N}have a chance to attack!{W1}
0940=Just try it!{W1}
0941=Astral...{W1}
0942=Gguuu....{W1}

095C=King Galam murmurs a{N}magic spell.{W1}
095D=Watch out!{W1}
095E=What?!{W1}
095F=Father!{W1}
0960=Don't worry...I'm fine.{W1}
0961=That was just a warning!{N}Do you want me to attack{N}again?{W1}
0962=King Granseal...{W2}
0963=Galam, please tell me...{N}What's in this tower?{N}In Ground Seal?{W1}
0964=You really want to know?{N}Ha, ha!  OK, I'll tell you.{W1}
0965=King Galam displays the{N}Jewel of Evil.{W1}
0966=I'll open the door to the{N}Evil World!{N}Observe!{W1}
0967=An earthquake!{W1}

0969=Why?  What's inside?{W1}
096A=You'll find out soon enough.{W1}
096B=What's he doing now??{W1}
096C=Here they come!{N}Ha, ha, ha!{W1}

0973={LEADER}, you're good{N}at performing acrobatics!{W1}
0974=Minister, help me!{W1}
0975=Y...yes...but how?{W1}
0976=Throw {LEADER} towards{N}the light tubes!{W1}
0977={LEADER}, save her!{W1}
0978=Too late.  You're too late.{W1}
0979=Oops, we lost our grip!{N}But...{W1}
097A={LEADER} grasped the{N}Jewel of Evil.{W1}
097B=What are you doing?{W2}
097C=Don't touch my jewel!{N}Don't touch it!{W1}
097D=I said, don't touch it!{W2}
097E=I'll shake you off!{W1}
097F=You're still there?{W1}
0980=Wow!  He's so brave.  Hmmm....{W1}
0981=I've almost got you now!{W1}
0982=No, you'll fall if you{N}open your hands now!{W1}

098B=We couldn't help the{N}Princess.{W1}
098C=(Sigh)....{W1}
098D={LEADER}, why do you{N}have two jewels?{W1}
098E={LEADER} explains{N}what happened.{W1}
098F=Indeed, perhaps...these{N}jewels are the key to{N}solving this....{W1}
0990=What?! Another earthquake?{W1}
0991=Wow!  It's getting worse!{W1}
0992=Whoa!{W1}
0993=Sssiirrr Astral!{N}What should we do?!{W1}
0994=I'm not sure.{W1}
0995=Sir Astral!{W1}
0996=Let's get out of here!{W2}
0997=We'll come back later with{N}soldiers to rescue her.{W1}
0998=But, Sir Astral...{W1}
0999=He won't budge.{N}We'll have to carry him.{W1}
099A=The Minister nods.{W1}

09A7=Huh?  Where is it?{W1}
09A8=It's...humph...{W1}
09A9={LEADER}...how come{N}you're here?{W1}
09AA=What a fool.{N}We came to help you!{W2}
09AB=You would be dead if we{N}hadn't come.{W1}
09AC=What are you talking about?{N}Oh, yeah!  I remember.{W2}
09AD=A huge rock fell on me after{N}you left.{W2}
09AE=It must have knocked me out.{N}Anyway, thank you.{W2}
09AF=Look at that!{N}The tunnel is blocked by{N}a rockslide.{W1}
09B0=Oh, what a pity.{N}Treasures may lie within....{W2}
09B1=I guess we'll never know.{W1}
09B2={LEADER}, let's go back{N}to the ship.{W1}
09B3=You'll come to the foot of{N}Mt. Volcano through this{N}dark cave.{W2}
09B4=But, I heard this cave is{N}home to a hobgoblin.{W1}
09B5=Yes, it is!{W1}
09B6=Wh...Who said that?{W1}
09B7=Me!  The hobgoblin!{W1}
09B8=Welcome to my home.{W2}
09B9=Enjoy your visit because{N}you're not leaving!{W1}
09BA=How can you...defeat...{N}devils?{W1}
09BB=Ah!  You have the Jewel of{N}Evil around your neck.{W2}
09BC=It's you, {LEADER}.{N}We've been waiting for you.{W1}
09BD={LEADER}, did you hear{N}that?  He said, he had{N}been waiting for you.{W2}
09BE=Why do the devils want you?{W1}
09BF={NAME;10}, are you OK?  {NAME;10}!{W1}
09C0=Squawk!  They knocked me{N}senseless.{W1}
09C1=Where are the devils?{N}{LEADER}, did you defeat{N}them?{W2}
09C2=Nobody in Bedoe can fight{N}like that.  Thank you.{W1}
09C3=He's a great fighter.{N}Volcanon doesn't know how{N}good he is!{W1}
09C4=He'll learn.{W2}
09C5=Let's go see the mayor and{N}get a raft!{W1}
09C6={CLEAR}{LEADER} decides to take{N}{NAME;10} the BDMN with him.{W1}{CLEAR}
09C7=This is the Ancient Hall{N}that leads to the Ancient{N}Tunnel...{W1}
09C8=There are more monsters here!{W2}
09C9={LEADER}, take 'em out!{W1}
09CA=It was lucky for me that I{N}met you.  Thank you.{W1}
09CB=Follow me to the Ancient{N}Tunnel.{W1}
09CC=Why is this door closed?{N}That's strange...{W2}
09CD=Oh well, let's go in.{W1}
09CE=What?  Let me try again.{W1}
09CF=Petro, my grandson, locked{N}the door.{W1}
09D0=Sorry, guys!  We can't go to{N}Grans Island this way.{W1}
09D1=Huh?  The raft stopped!{W1}
09D2=Did the water stop flowing?{N}What's happening?{W1}
09D3=Wow!{D1}  What's that?{W1}
09D4={LEADER}, look there!{W1}
09D5=M...{D1}monster!{N}It appeared from the river!{W1}
09D6=It must be the monster they{N}mentioned in Polca.{W2}
09D7=Watch out!{W1}
09D8=Stop!{W1}
09D9=Who IS that big guy?{W1}
09DA=Don't you know?{W1}
09DB=That's Taros.  The guardian of{N}this ancient shrine.{W1}
09DC=Again, stop right there, or{N}I'll attack you.{W1}
09DD=What should we do?{W1}
09DE=The Caravan is there, behind{N}him.  We must have it!{W1}
09DF=Time's up!  Now we battle.{W1}
09E0={LEADER}, you're much{N}stronger than I thought.{W1}
09E1=It's so small.  I'll just{N}try to...get inside....{W1}
09E2=Oh, he's gone!{W1}
09E3=I hope he comes back.{N}Did {NAME;11} lie to us?{W1}
09E4=I never lie!{W1}
09E5=The Ancients were...how{N}should I say this...great!{W1}
09E6=No wonder the Caravan is so{N}small.  It carries miniaturized{N}people and items.{W2}
09E7=I can drive this excellent{N}vehicle.  May I go with you{N}as a driver?{W1}
09E8={NAME;11} the historian{N}tags along with the force.{W1}
09E9=You're kidding, right?{W1}
09EA=Well, at least we can bring{N}a lot of soldiers with us.{W1}
09EB=But soldiers in the Caravan{N}cannot enter battle 'cause{N}they've been miniaturized.{W1}
09EC=We'll just have to see.{W1}
09ED=Humph.  I don't like this guy.{W1}
09EE=I wonder what adventures{N}we'll find with this Caravan!{W1}
09EF=Wait!{W1}
09F0=What's wrong, Oddler?{W1}
09F1={LEADER}...{NAME;7}...can{N}you hear that?{W1}
09F2=Hear what?{W1}
09F3=I don't hear anything.{W1}
09F4=Somebody is crying for help...{W2}
09F5=from...over here.{W1}
09F6=It's coming from this{N}direction.{W1}
09F7=Look!  Over there!{W1}
09F8=Help me!{W1}
09F9=An...elven boy?{N}He's stuck in the pond.{W2}
09FA=He must be very tired.{N}Let's pull him out.{W1}
09FB=Did you come to help me?{N}Oh, thank you!{W2}
09FC=I might have been eaten by{N}monsters if you hadn't come.{W1}
09FD=My dinner is escaping!{W1}
09FE=Who said that?{W1}
09FF=That pond catches my food.{N}Hey elf boy, good trap, huh?{W2}
0A00=Those who get stuck in the{N}pond are mine.  It's my{N}rule.{W1}
0A01=Then, all the missing people{N}were eaten by you?{W1}
0A02=They were in my pond.{W1}
0A03=And this elf is my dinner{N}for tonight.  Got it?{W1}
0A04=Did you guys bring the{N}ketchup? No? Oh, well.{W1}
0A05={LEADER}, we have to{N}save him!{W1}
0A06=I'm {NAME;13}, an archer.{N}I had no idea how dangerous{N}this pond was.{W2}
0A07=You saved my life.{N}Thank you.{W1}
0A08=You should thank Oddler.{W2}
0A09=He heard your cry for help{N}and brought us here.{W1}
0A0A=Oh well, it was nothing.{W1}
0A0B=An elf always returns a{N}favor.{W2}
0A0C=Please, let me help you.{W1}
0A0D={LEADER}, looks like{N}we've found another friend.{W1}
0A0E=Oh, thank you!{W1}
0A0F=Now, let's go see Mr. Creed!{W1}
0A10=(Sniff, sniff)...I smell{N}more invaders from the east.{W2}
0A11=This is the territory of{N}Mr. Creed.{W1}
0A12=Go away!{W1}
0A13=But we have to see him.{W2}
0A14=Please let us pass!{W1}
0A15=No!  Leave now!{W1}
0A16=Never mind.  Get 'em boys!{W1}
0A17=Hurry!  Let's go into{N}Creed's mansion.{W1}
0A18=Oddler, can you see?{W1}
0A19=No, why?{W1}
0A1A=You're moving around as{N}if you can see.{W1}
0A1B=Am I?  Maybe my other{N}senses have sharpened{N}since I lost my sight.{W1}
0A1C=Oh, I see.{W1}
0A1D={LEADER}, let's go see{N}Mr. Creed!{W1}
0A1E=There's a wobbly rock.{W1}
0A1F=That rock looks{N}suspicious....{W1}
0A20=Maybe {NAME;13} can{N}help us.{W1}
0A21=Fairy said, move this rock{N}in this manner, and...{W1}
0A22=Got it!  Thanks, fairy!{W1}
0A23={LEADER}, come on.{W1}
0A24=Answer me!{N}Where are you going?{W1}
0A25=Ah...I...{W1}
0A26=You were going to South{N}Parmecia to get help, right?{W1}
0A27=I...uh...{W1}
0A28=Paladins of Pacalon are{N}cowards!  {NAME;19}, don't{N}you have any pride?{W2}
0A29=Wimp!{W1}
0A2A=Shut up!  Mr. {NAME;19} is{N}the bravest soldier in the{N}world!{W1}
0A2B=I can defend myself.{W1}
0A2C=Come on, you half-breed!{W1}
0A2D=Are you afraid of me?{N}I'll turn my back to you.{N}Now, run away you cowards!{W1}
0A2E=You've gone too far!{W1}
0A2F=Aaaauuuuu!{W1}
0A30=Pacalon soldiers have no{N}honor.  They attack while{N}my back is turned!{W1}
0A31=What?!{W2}
0A32=If Mr. {NAME;19} was not{N}ill, you'd be history!{W1}
0A33=Oh, is {NAME;19} ill?{W1}
0A34=In that case, you can try{N}and take me.{W1}
0A35=I can no longer put up with{N}these insults!{W1}
0A36=No, no!{W1}
0A37=Grruuu....{W1}
0A38=You look so sad,{N}{NAME;19}....{W1}
0A39=You're not just a normal{N}devil soldier.{W1}
0A3A=You're right, {NAME;19}.{N}I see why you're the leader{N}of the Pacalon Army.{W2}
0A3B=I'm Geshp!  An adviser for{N}Zeon!{W1}
0A3C=How did you know my name?{W1}
0A3D=I know everything.{W1}
0A3E=Now, tell me the reason why{N}
0A3F=you're keeping me alive.{W1}
0A40=Ha, ha!  You're smart!{W1}
0A41=What did you do?{W1}
0A42=I...can't...!{N}My body won't...{W1}
0A43=I came here to borrow your{N}body.{W2}
0A44=Ha, ha!  Welcome our new{N}leader!{W1}
0A45=Stop!!!{W1}
0A46=Who said that?{W1}
0A47=A force from the south?{N}How?{W2}
0A48=Where did you come from?{W1}
0A49=We're from Granseal!{W1}
0A4A=But, that's on the other....{W1}
0A4B=I'd better leave...{W2}
0A4C=Devil soldiers!  Stop that{N}force from Granseal!{W1}
0A4D=Is he alright?{W1}
0A4E=We have to save him before{N}he is possessed by an evil...{W1}
0A4F=What happened?{W2}
0A50=Ah...I was almost possessed{N}by that devil.{W1}
0A51=Thank you.{N}How can I repay you for{N}your kindness?{W1}
0A52=Are you OK now?  Good.{W2}
0A53=May I ask you, where were{N}you going in such a wounded{N}state?{W1}
0A54=Pacalon, my country.  We{N}are fighting against the{N}devils.{W2}
0A55=But, no country in North{N}Parmecia has enough power{N}to resist them.{W2}
0A56=So, I was heading south to{N}find some allies.{W1}
0A57=You don't have to go any{N}further.{W1}
0A58=Then, you're from South{N}Parmecia?{W1}
0A59=Yes, Granseal.{W1}
0A5A=Oh, how lucky!  Please{N}come with me to Pacalon!{W1}
0A5B=But, we have to go to{N}Tristan.{W1}
0A5C=Oh, please...I can't return{N}to Pacalon without allies.{W2}
0A5D=Maybe, when you're done...{W2}
0A5E=OK, I'll go with you.{W1}
0A5F=But, you're injured{N}Mr. {NAME;19}.{W1}
0A60=No problem.  I don't know{N}why, but I'm much better.{W1}
0A61=Let's go to Pacalon.{W1}
0A62=Where did you come from?{N}What are you doing here?{W1}
0A63=Don't you know about the{N}restrictions?{W1}
0A64=Even if you didn't know,{N}that's just to bad.{W1}
0A65=Wow, look at that?{W1}
0A66=Those monsters are eating{N}the bridge.{W1}
0A67=Help!  Help me!{W1}
0A68=Look!{W2}
0A69=She's stranded on the{N}bridge.{W1}
0A6A=Get away from the bridge{N}before it falls into the{N}river!{W1}
0A6B=I sprained my ankle!{N}Please help me!{W2}
0A6C=I can't stand up!{W1}
0A6D={LEADER}, defeat all the{N}monsters!  Hurry!{W1}
0A6E=Phew!  That was close!{W1}
0A6F=Thank you very much.{W2}
0A70=Excuse me, will you help{N}me up?{W1}
0A71=NO!  I'll do it!{W1}
0A72=We'll take you with us.{W2}
0A73=Tristan is the nearest town.{N}I think you had better rest{N}there.{W1}
0A74=Thank you, sir.{W1}
0A75=You sure are being nice.{N}Hmmm....{W2}
0A76=Anyway, Tristan is just over{N}there.  Let's go.{W1}
0A77={LEADER}...{NAME;7}...{W1}
0A78=What?  Don't you want to{N}go to Tristan?{W1}
0A79=Oh, I do, but...{W1}
0A7A=We shouldn't go to Tristan{N}right now.{W1}
0A7B=Why not?{W1}
0A7C=Because of me!{W1}
0A7D=Wh...who are you?!{W2}
0A7E=Are you a devil?{W1}
0A7F=I'm one of the leaders of{N}the Devil Army.{N}My name is Cameela!{W1}
0A80=What do you want?{W1}
0A81={LEADER}, I came here{N}to get your Jewel of Evil!{W1}
0A82=Zeon told US to bring it to{N}the Ancient Tower.{N}He didn't mention you.{W2}
0A83=And since we've never heard{N}of you, you're not getting{N}the jewel!{W1}
0A84=No!  His orders were...{W1}
0A85=If Zeon finds out, you will{N}be...{W1}
0A86=He'll forgive me when I{N}bring him the jewel.{W2}
0A87=Enough talking!  Hand over{N}that jewel.  In return, I'll{N}spare Sir Astral!{W2}
0A88=Do you want me to kill this{N}old man?{W1}
0A89=The jewel can't be removed{N}from {LEADER}'s neck.{W2}
0A8A=Do you really think that you{N}can kill me?{W1}
0A8B=Of course.{W1}
0A8C=HA!{W1}
0A8D=Ooops!{W1}
0A8E=Well done.  You dodged my{N}fireball.{W1}
0A8F=What a surprising old wizard!{W2}
0A90=I didn't think I could obtain{N}the jewel that easily.{N}Ha, ha!{W2}
0A91=This is gonna be fun!{N}{LEADER}!{N}Keep it for a while.{W1}
0A92=Wait!{W1}
0A93=Be careful of Geshp and{N}Zalbard!{W1}
0A94=Ah, she's gone....{N}OK, {LEADER}.{N}Let's go to Tristan.{W1}
0A95=Would you please explain{N}what just happened?{W1}
0A96=You don't know?{W2}
0A97=Everything here was set up{N}by Cameela.{W2}
0A98=It was a trap to get the{N}Jewel of Evil.{W1}
0A99=Your fireball...as if you{N}knew what she was from the{N}beginning.{W1}
0A9A=Yes, I did.{W2}
0A9B=Her evil aura was apparent.{N}By the way, did you hear{N}what she said?{W2}
0A9C=They're all acting on their{N}own, ignoring Zeon's orders.{W2}
0A9D=It will be dangerous.{N}We must be careful.{W1}
0A9E=You can't enter Mitula{N}Shrine now.{W1}
0A9F=Sir Astral, what do we do{N}now?{W1}
0AA0=Hmmm....{W1}
0AA1={LEADER}, what do you{N}think?{W1}
0AA2=I'm not sure.{W1}
0AA3={LEADER}, it's obvious!{W1}
0AA4=I agree.  We have to see the{N}storytellers and listen to{N}the legends.{W2}
0AA5=Make a break for it!{W1}
0AA6=Wait, wait.  You must not{N}enter the holy shrine.{W2}
0AA7=So be it!  Let the truth be{N}known!{W1}
0AA8=Go away!  The devils already{N}occupy this shrine!{W1}
0AA9=Devils again!{W2}
0AAA={LEADER}, attack!{W1}
0AAB=Welcome, Granseal force!{W1}
0AAC=What?{W1}
0AAD=I heard a voice from the{N}other side of the door.{W1}
0AAE=I'm Zalbard.  I'm one of{N}the greater devils.{W1}
0AAF=Do come in.  Of course, you{N}can go back now and abandon{N}Mitula!{W1}
0AB0=Sir Astral...{W2}
0AB1=The greater devil that{N}attacked Bedoe was as{N}strong as Volcanon.{W1}
0AB2=Are you talking about{N}Sir Odd Eye?{W2}
0AB3=Did he fight against{N}Volcanon at Bedoe?{W1}
0AB4=Yes.  And he lost.{W1}
0AB5=I can't believe it!{N}Odd Eye is the strongest{N}devil among us.{W2}
0AB6=But, we haven't been able to{N}contact him lately.{W2}
0AB7=This is good news for me.{N}If I get the Jewel of Evil, I{N}can take his place.{W2}
0AB8=Now, enter the shrine.{N}Mitula is here.{W1}
0AB9=What should we do?{N}A greater devil awaits us{N}inside.{W1}
0ABA=Odd Eye...Odd Eye...{N}Odd...Eye....{W1}
0ABB=Sir Astral?{W1}
0ABC=I think I've heard that{N}name before....{W1}
0ABD=Sir Astral?{W1}
0ABE=Hmmmm....{W1}
0ABF=Sir Astral!!!{W1}
0AC0=Whhhhhhat?{N}{NAME;7}, don't scare me!{W1}
0AC1=What's wrong with you?{W2}
0AC2=Should we go into the shrine{N}now?{W1}
0AC3=Oh, sorry.{W1}
0AC4=Zalbard...at least he's not{N}as strong as Odd Eye.{W2}
0AC5=But still, he's a greater{N}devil.{W2}
0AC6=We had better complete our{N}preparations before we go in.{W1}
0AC7=OK.{W1}
0AC8=What a pleasure!{N}Nice to meet you.{W1}
0AC9=Ohhh....{N}He's ugly, isn't he?{W1}
0ACA=What?!{N}You dare insult me?!{W2}
0ACB=I've never...{N}For that you will die!{W1}
0ACC=Are you ready to die?{W1}
0ACD=Grrr...impossible!{N}Why...do I have to die?{W1}
0ACE=Where is Mitula?{W1}
0ACF=I don't know...haven't{N}seen her.{W1}
0AD0=Oops!  The Ground Orb....{W1}
0AD1=I can't endure the light....{N}Ohhh....{W1}
0AD2=Thanks to the Ground Orb, we{N}finally defeated Zalbard.{W2}
0AD3=The orb released holy power{N}in it's light.{W1}
0AD4=Hey, look over there!{W1}
0AD5=Welcome!{W1}
0AD6=Thank you.{W2}
0AD7=I've finally returned to this{N}world.{W1}
0AD8=Goddess Mitula?{W1}
0AD9=Oh, nice to meet you,{N}Sir Astral.{W1}
0ADA=Oh, you know my name?{N}Gee....{W2}
0ADB=Please tell us, what should{N}we do now?{W1}
0ADC=I don't know.{W1}
0ADD=What?!{W2}
0ADE=But, why?  You're a goddess.{N}You know our future, right?{W1}
0ADF=I'm not Volcanon.  I never{N}tell people the future, even{N}if it could prevent death.{W1}
0AE0=Death?!  Not ours I hope.{W1}
0AE1=Zeon is an unimaginably{N}strong devil.{W2}
0AE2=If he attains full power,{N}I, even Volcanon, would not{N}be able to stop him.{W1}
0AE3=So, we have to defeat him{N}before he revives completely.{W1}
0AE4=His power is sealed in the{N}Jewel of Evil.{W1}
0AE5=So, that's why he wants the{N}jewel!{W1}
0AE6=Then, why don't we keep the{N}jewel forever.{W1}
0AE7=Arc Valley is the place where{N}evil power gathers.{W2}
0AE8=He will recover his power{N}if he stays there long enough.{W1}
0AE9=Did you say, Arc Valley?{W1}
0AEA=You call it Ancient Tower{N}or Granseal.{W2}
0AEB=Granseal is named for the{N}symbol in the tower.{N}It seals the ground.{W1}
0AEC=I see.{W1}
0AED=Goddess Mitula, where are{N}you going?{W1}
0AEE=Down to the surface.{N}To save the people.{W1}
0AEF=Are you going to abandon us,{N}as Volcanon did?{W1}
0AF0=Well...no.{N}I'll give you a hint.{W2}
0AF1=Listen to the legends from{N}the storytellers before you{N}go to Grans Island.{W1}
0AF2=You can't kill Zeon, but{N}Volcanon and I will help you{N}if you weaken him.{W2}
0AF3={LEADER}!{N}You are the chosen one.{N}You have the holy jewel.{W2}
0AF4=We need your help to reseal{N}Zeon.{N}Find the holy sword.{W1}
0AF5=Where is it?{N}How can we find it?{W1}
0AF6=It's on Grans.{N}Your jewel will lead you to...{W1}
0AF7=Mitula, Mitula!!{W1}
0AF8={LEADER}, Mitula{N}has vanished!{N}What should we do now?{W1}
0AF9=We have to go to Arc Valley{N}on Grans Island.{W2}
0AFA={LEADER}, find the{N}storytellers first.{W1}
0AFB=Finally, you've left the{N}castle, Vicar {NAME;22}.{W1}
0AFC=Geshp!{W1}
0AFD=So, you remember me. {W1}
0AFE=What do you want?{W1}
0AFF=I have plans for you.{W2}
0B00=I'm very happy that you came{N}out of the castle.{W1}
0B01=Why?{W1}
0B02=I have been waiting for{N}{NAME;22}.{W2}
0B03=Vicar {NAME;22}, you locked{N}the gate of Moun, remember?{W2}
0B04=My faithful soldiers can't{N}enter Parmecia.{N}Now, you will open it!{W1}
0B05=It's a trap!{W2}
0B06={NAME;22}, run!{W1}
0B07=Ha, ha.  He can't.{W1}
0B08=Cameela!  Cameeeeeela!{W1}
0B09=Cameela?!  We met her in{N}Pangoat Valley.{W1}
0B0A=What?{W1}
0B0B=Ah, Cameela.  You're here.{W2}
0B0C=Get the key for me!{W1}
0B0D=Geshp, you're as devious as{N}usual.{W1}
0B0E=That I am.  Now, get the key!{W1}
0B0F=Me?!  Why?{W1}
0B10=Cameela!{W1}
0B11=I hate you!{N}I won't help you.{W2}
0B12=You want the key?{N}You get it!{N}You can use my army.{W2}
0B13=See you later.{W1}
0B14=That witch!{W2}
0B15=Cameela!  Cameela!!{W1}
0B16=They're divided....{W1}
0B17=I don't need your help,{N}Cameela!{W2}
0B18=Come on, devils!{N}Kill {LEADER} now!{W1}
0B19=Bye, {LEADER}.{W1}
0B1A=You're not staying?{W1}
0B1B=I'm good at using my brains,{N}not my strength.{W2}
0B1C=I'll return by the time{N}you're defeated.{W1}
0B1D=I heard about you from{N}Geshp.{W1}
0B1E=He ordered me to take out{N}some of your people.{W2}
0B1F=But, it's not enough.{N}This is the end of your{N}resistance.{W1}
0B20=Kill them, kill them all!{W1}
0B21=I'm tired of this.  I can no{N}longer fight for devils.{W1}
0B22={NAME;23}, what?{W1}
0B23=Didn't you hear me?{W1}
0B24=Hey, Granseal guys!{N}I'm on your side from now{N}on! OK?{W1}
0B25=I can't believe it!{N}You might have been killed{N}by the devils.{W1}
0B26=Indeed!  Why did you{N}change your mind?{W1}
0B27=I'm {NAME;23}, from Galam.{N}I was waiting for the chance{N}to escape from them.{W2}
0B28=I can't stand their wicked{N}ways!{W1}
0B29=You have the same opinion{N}of them as we do.{W1}
0B2A=Please let me join you!{N}I could be a great help to{N}you.{W2}
0B2B=You need a professional{N}soldier like me.{W1}
0B2C=Oh, we welcome you.{W1}
0B2D=But, he was on the other{N}side just an minute ago.{W1}
0B2E=I don't care, {NAME;7}.{N}He has seen the error of his{N}ways.{W1}
0B2F={LEADER}, don't you want{N}{NAME;23} to join our{N}force?{W1}
0B30=Oh, thank you!{W2}
0B31=I'll try to do my best!{W1}
0B32=I'm opening the gate of Moun.{N}Devils are waiting inside.{N}Be careful!{W1}
0B33=Vicar {NAME;22} uses{N}the gate key.{W1}
0B34=Welcome, losers!{W2}
0B35=Will you follow the example{N}of the people of Moun and die{N}without resistance?{W1}
0B36=No!  I'm too late.{N}I killed a lot of people.{W2}
0B37=I can never forgive myself!{W1}
0B38={LEADER}, please let me{N}fight with you.  They must{N}die!{W1}
0B39={LEADER}, {NAME;22} will be{N}a great asset.{W1}
0B3A={NAME} returns to the{N}Caravan.{W1}
0B3B={LEADER}, {NAME;22} is{N}right.  They must die!{W1}
0B3C=There may be some survivors{N}somewhere.{W1}
0B3D=Do not touch my rock!{W1}
0B3E=Did you defeat all those{N}devils?{W2}
0B3F=I was wondering why it became{N}quiet so suddenly.{W1}
0B40=Are you a survivor?{N}Are you from Moun?{N}What's your name?{W1}
0B41=I am {NAME;26}.{N}I am not from Moun.{W1}
0B42=Then, where are you from?{W1}
0B43=The past.{W1}
0B44=What do you mean?{W1}
0B45=I cannot explain.{W2}
0B46=I am what I am.{N}That is all that I am.{W1}
0B47=I've never seen anyone like{N}you.{W2}
0B48=Where are the people of{N}Moun?  Were there any{N}survivors?{W1}
0B49=Some.{W1}
0B4A=That's good news.{W2}
0B4B=And where are they?{W1}
0B4C=Down here.  Follow me.{W1}
0B4D={LEADER}, hurry!{N}Follow {NAME;26}!{W2}
0B4E={NAME;26} knows where{N}they're hiding.{W1}
0B4F=Hello, Granseal soldiers.{W1}
0B50=Remember?  I promised that I{N}would see you again.{W2}
0B51=Come on.  Let's party!{W1}
0B52=Stop!  You need my war plan!{W1}
0B53=You again, Geshp?  Why don't{N}you leave me alone?{W1}
0B54=Zeon left me in charge.{W2}
0B55=It doesn't matter if you are{N}killed or not.{W1}
0B56=Then kill me, if you've{N}got the guts to do it!{W2}
0B57=I know.  You want me to be{N}die!{W1}
0B58=Geshp, you coward!{N}I'll kill you first!{W1}
0B59=I have no time to waste.{N}I must go.{W2}
0B5A=Silly Cameela.{N}You can't survive without my{N}brains.{W1}
0B5B={LEADER}, did you hear that?{N}He said you would win!{W2}
0B5C=He must be a bad{N}fortuneteller.{W1}
0B5D=We can get a ship and return{N}to Grans if we defeat her.{W2}
0B5E={LEADER}, get her!{W1}
0B5F={LEADER}, I lost?!{N}Take this.{W1}
0B60=Cameela reveals the Sky Orb.{W1}
0B61=This is the Sky Orb.  With{N}it, you can drive the Nazca{N}Ship.{W2}
0B62=Listen.  You have to be very{N}careful from now on.{W2}
0B63=Geshp has Prism Flowers.{N}He will...{W1}
0B64=Your life is over,{N}Cameela!{W1}
0B65=Geshp!{W1}
0B66=Ha, ha, ha!  You acted just{N}as I planned!{W1}
0B67=Ouuuuu...Ges...{W1}
0B68=How horrible!{W1}
0B69=It's the law.  Traitors{N}die by fire.{W2}
0B6A=Congratulations!{N}You have a ship now!{N}Come to Grans!{W2}
0B6B=I have to go now and{N}prepare your welcoming{N}party!{W1}
0B6C=I really hate him!{W2}
0B6D=Prism Flowers?{N}What are they?{W1}
0B6E=I have no idea, but it's{N}probably a trap.{W1}
0B6F=Ancient flower.{W1}
0B70=Excuse me?{W1}
0B71=Ancient countries had those{N}flowers along their borders.{W1}
0B72=What kind of flowers are{N}they?{W1}
0B73=I cannot explain....{W1}
0B74=We will see them when we{N}arrive at Grans.{W1}
0B75={LEADER}, grab the Sky{N}Orb.{N}Let's go.{W1}
0B76=You're still alive?{W1}
0B77=Geshp!{W1}
0B78=Unbelievable!{N}You really are persistent.{W1}
0B79=We'll never stop!{W2}
0B7A=We will not die until we{N}destroy all of you.{W1}
0B7B={LEADER}, kill him!{W2}
0B7C=We have to kill him now!{W1}
0B7D=I'm very sorry, but I have{N}to go.{W1}
0B7E=Don't let them advance!{W1}
0B7F=He escaped again!{W1}
0B80=Geshp sure is a tricky{N}devil.{W2}
0B81=After him, now!{W1}
0B82=You're early!{N}{W2}
0B83=Darn you, Granseal swine!{W2}
0B84=But, don't worry.  I just{N}finished my preparations.{N}Yes...everything's ready.{W2}
0B85=It's show time!{W1}
0B86=Sir Astral, why is he smiling?{W1}
0B87=He believes this is the place{N}where we will die....{W1}
0B88={LEADER}, be careful!{W1}
0B89=Prism Flowers?{W2}
0B8A=My Prism Flowers!{W1}
0B8B={LEADER}, I shall return{N}with Red Baron!{N}You'll pay for this!{W1}
0B8C=Now you shall pay for killing{N}my precious Prism Flowers.{W1}
0B8D=Geshp again.{W1}
0B8E=Hee, hee, hee.{W1}
0B8F=Do you have another cunning{N}trap for us?{W1}
0B90=Would I do that?{W2}
0B91=I just want to introduce you{N}to my friend.{W1}
0B92=Red Baron, say hello!{W1}
0B93=Grruuooouu!{W1}
0B94=He's waiting for you just{N}outside the Galam gate.{W2}
0B95=You have to defeat him if you{N}want to advance.{W2}
0B96=See his red armor?{N}It's smeared with blood.{W2}
0B97=He has killed many people.{W1}
0B98=Now, it's your turn.{W2}
0B99=This will be your undoing.{W1}
0B9A=Galam is just over there,{N}but...{W1}
0B9B=We have to advance.{N}{LEADER}, are you ready?{W1}
0B9C=Sir Astral, he's...crying!{W1}
0B9D=Why would he be crying?{W1}
0B9E=I think I've seen his style{N}of fighting before.{N}Let's see his face.{W1}
0B9F=Astral removes the mask.{W1}
0BA0=Huh?{W1}
0BA1=It's {NAME;28}!{W1}
0BA2=Let me see him.{W1}
0BA3=Wow, he's alive!{W1}
0BA4={NAME;28}!  {NAME;28}!{W1}
0BA5=Where?!{W1}
0BA6=What?!{W1}
0BA7=Oh, Sir Astral!  I had an{N}awful nightmare.{W2}
0BA8=I was controlled by someone{N}and I killed a lot of...{W1}
0BA9=It wasn't a dream.{W1}
0BAA=What?!{W1}
0BAB=You were being controlled{N}by a devil.{W2}
0BAC=And he made you kill every{N}person you saw.{W2}
0BAD=You recovered your senses{N}when we defeated the devils.{W1}
0BAE=I can't believe it!{N}I'm {NAME;28}, I'm...{W1}
0BAF=What can I do?{N}How can I atone for my sins?{W1}
0BB0=Sir Astral, tell me.{W1}
0BB1=You're not at fault.{W1}
0BB2=It's not your fault.{N}The devils are to blame.{W1}
0BB3=But...{W1}
0BB4=I have to die for my sins.{N}It will be my atonement.{W2}
0BB5=I have to die!{W1}
0BB6=Oh, poor {NAME;28}.{W1}
0BB7=Sir Astral, {NAME;28} has{N}fled. {W2}
0BB8=Will you let him die?{W1}
0BB9={NAME;28} is an immortal{N}vampire now.  He can't die{N}very easily.{W1}
0BBA=I think we'll meet him again.{N}{LEADER}, let's go.{W1}
0BBB=Stop!{W1}
0BBC=Finally, you've arrived.{W2}
0BBD=It was a mistake to{N}underestimate you.{W2}
0BBE=But, the game is not over.{N}At the risk of my life,{N}you'll proceed no further!{W1}
0BBF=Geshp is serious.{N}He finally considers us{N}worthy opponents.{W2}
0BC0={LEADER}, be careful.{N}We mustn't underrate his{N}power.{W1}
0BC1=You're right, Astral!{W2}
0BC2=Zeon doesn't trust me,{N}thanks to you!{W2}
0BC3=This is my last chance.{N}I can't see him again 'til I{N}bring him your head.{W1}
0BC4=My traps...{W1}
0BC5=I'm...at the end of my rope.{N}I...must...escape.{W1}
0BC6=Nooooooo!{W1}
0BC7=Please...please let me go.{W1}
0BC8=We don't want to kill{N}you.{N}You've lost your powers.{W1}
0BC9=I know...(sob, sob)....{W1}
0BCA=You may go.{W1}
0BCB=Thank you.{W1}
0BCC=I won't forget this.{W1}
0BCD=Where are you going, Geshp?{W1}
0BCE=Do you remember your vow?{W1}
0BCF=You failed to get the jewel{N}from {LEADER}.{W2}
0BD0=Now, you will pay with your{N}life.{W1}
0BD1=No, please...NO!{W1}
0BD2=Zeon is such an unfeeling{N}devil...(shiver).{W1}
0BD3=He will do the same to us{N}if we lose to him.{W1}
0BD4=We must not be defeated.{W1}
0BD5=I just heard that Geshp{N}lost.{W2}
0BD6=All greater devils have been{N}defeated except for Odd Eye.{W1}
0BD7=This is a good chance for us{N}to become greater devils!{W2}
0BD8=I'm sure Zeon will promote{N}us if we can get the jewel.{W1}
0BD9=Look over there!{W1}
0BDA=They're coming!{W1}
0BDB=Excellent!{N}Welcome to your graveyard!{W1}
0BDC={LEADER}, you're finally{N}here.{W1}
0BDD=Is that...?{W1}
0BDE=Did you forget about me,{N}{LEADER} and {NAME;7}!{W1}
0BDF=Oddler, are you Odd Eye?{N}Zalbard said...{W1}
0BE0=Yes, I am he.{W1}
0BE1=You're the leader of the Devil{N}Army who attacked Bedoe...{W1}
0BE2=Yes I am, Sir Astral.{W1}
0BE3=How do you know me?{W1}
0BE4={LEADER} told me about{N}you repeatedly.{W1}
0BE5=What do YOU want?{W1}
0BE6=Don't talk to me like that.{N}I'm very sad.{W1}
0BE7=Sad?{N}You've got to be joking!{W1}
0BE8=Well, yes I am.{N}I'm really quite evil.{W1}
0BE9=Don't you think so, Red{N}Baron?{W1}
0BEA=Uhh...(shiver).{W1}
0BEB=Anyway, I came here to{N}deliver an ultimatum.{W2}
0BEC=Think long and well before{N}answering me.{W2}
0BED=Leave the jewel, your{N}weapons, and your items{N}here...or DIE!{W1}
0BEE=That means...we don't have{N}to fight him.{W1}
0BEF=True, but we can't take the{N}easy way out.  We mustn't{N}give him the jewel.{W1}
0BF0=You know how strong I am.{N}I think you had better{N}accept the offer.{W1}
0BF1=Hmmm....{W1}
0BF2=Oh, what should we do?!{W1}
0BF3=We have to fight!{W1}

0BFE=Odd Eye...no, Oddler!{N}Did you...?{W1}
0BFF=No, {NAME;7}.  I did my{N}best.  You were just better{N}than me.{W1}
0C00=We had to be.{W1}
0C01=I wouldn't have had to{N}fight if I never had gotten{N}my memory back.{W2}
0C02=It's funny, fighting was{N}everything to me.{W1}
0C03=Oddler, please don't die!{W1}
0C04=Thank you, {NAME;7}.{N}I learned a lot from you.{W2}
0C05=Oh, the pain!{N}Let me say good-bye.{W1}
0C06=If possible, I want to{N}relive my life...not as{N}a devil...next time....{W1}
0C07=(Sob, sob)...how sad.{N}{LEADER}, Sir Astral...{W1}
0C08=Oddler had a pure spirit...{N}I'll miss him.{W1}
0C09=Don't cry for him now.{N}This is Zeon's doing.{W1}

0C1C=We haven't killed her yet.{N}She will be the first{N}sacrifice for King Zeon.{W1}
0C1D=What?!{W2}
0C1E=Zeon said, you'd return her{N}in exchange for the jewel!{W1}
0C1F=Ha, ha, ha!  He lied.{W2}
0C20=You killed our greater{N}devils.{N}I can't allow this to go on.{W2}

0C40=Zeon!{W1}
0C41=You resisted me....{W2}
0C42=I...I never...!{W1}
0C43={LEADER}, we had better{N}run away and return later.{W1}
0C44=Sir Astral, we can't!{W1}
0C45=Why not?{W1}
0C46=Princess Elis fainted when{N}she saw Zeon.{W1}
0C47=What?  Oh, my.{W1}
0C48=And now we're surrounded{N}by devils.{W1}
0C49={LEADER}, believe in your{N}sword and the jewel!{N}We must fight Zeon now!{W1}
0C4A=Let's go!{W1}
0C4B=Devils?{W2}
0C4C=They can't enter the shrine.{W1}
0C4D=This is a sacred area.{W2}
0C4E=Volcanon's shrine is here.{W1}
0C4F=God Volcanon!{N}I'm back!{W1}
0C50=Welcome back, {NAME;7}.{N}You look well.{W1}

0C55=They help each other.{N}I made some friends.{W1}
0C56=Wonderful.  It must've been{N}a good experience for you.{W1}
0C57=I've brought a friend.{W1}
0C58=This is {LEADER}.{N}He's from Granseal.{W1}
0C59=Granseal!{W1}
0C5A=People of Grans Island{N}caused a serious, deadly{N}problem for the world!{W1}
0C5B=Volcanon?{W1}
0C5C=They awakened Zeon, the{N}legendary devil!{W2}
0C5D=I've been protecting all the{N}ground-dwelling people.{W2}
0C5E=I can't forgive them for{N}this!{W1}
0C5F=Volcanon, please calm down!{W2}
0C60={LEADER} is not the person{N}who did it!{W1}
0C61=Everybody who lives on the{N}ground is responsibile.{W2}
0C62=They have to solve this by{N}themselves.{W1}
0C63=What should {LEADER} do?{W1}
0C64=My protection ceases now!{W2}
0C65=He must face the devils on{N}his own.{W1}
0C66=But...{W2}
0C67=Even the greater devils{N}are as strong as you!{W1}
0C68=If all the humans are{N}annihilated, that's OK.{N}It's their destiny.{W2}
0C69=I want them to show me{N}courage.{W2}
0C6A=They must reseal the devil{N}again.{W1}
0C6B=Then, please give some{N}advice to {LEADER}.{W1}
0C6C={LEADER}, believe in the{N}power of the jewel.{W2}
0C6D=It belongs to both the{N}light and the darkness.{W2}
0C6E=It shows its true power{N}when the light and the{N}darkness are as one.{W2}
0C6F=You may go now.  I don't{N}want to see anybody until{N}Zeon is defeated.{W1}
0C70=Volcanon!{W1}
0C71={LEADER}, we'll defeat{N}that devil by ourselves!{W1}
0C72=I didn't know he was such a{N}cold-hearted god.{W2}
0C73=OK, I'll help you!  I'll{N}go with you to reseal the{N}devil!{W1}
0C74=This shrine was built on top{N}of the mountain to watch{N}over everything.{W1}
0C75=Do you know the legend{N}of the phoenix?{W1}
0C76=And {NAME;7} was born from{N}holy fire.{W2}
0C77=Volcanon is the highest{N}of gods and can revive{N}anything.{W2}
0C78=Phoenix serve and work for{N}him.{N}They help the people.{W1}
0C79=A phoenix is the legendary{N}bird who can't be killed.{W2}
0C7A=It is life itself.{W2}
0C7B=When his first life is{N}nearly over, he bursts into{N}holy fire to finish it.{W2}
0C7C=The fire creates another{N}life for the phoenix on the{N}ground.{W1}
0C7D=Stop!{W1}
0C7E=Who said that?{W1}
0C7F=Wow, what a huge guy!{W1}
0C80=Leave here!{N}I'll attack you if you don't!{W1}

0C98=The barrier around Grans{N}Island is too strong.{N}I can't see anything.{W1}
0C99=Please try again!{W1}
0C9A=If I touch something of his,{N}maybe I could contact his{N}mind better....{W1}
0C9B={LEADER}, you have the{N}Jewel of Evil, right?{W1}
0C9C=Is this true, {LEADER}?{W2}
0C9D=That's one of the magic{N}jewels used to seal{N}Zeon.  Give it to me.{W1}
0C9E=But, we can't remove it.{W1}
0C9F=I can.{W1}
0CA0=Let me see it.{W1}
0CA1=Whhoooa!{W2}
0CA2=What's that light?{N}There are two!{W1}
0CA3=The other one is...{N}...ahhh...they called it,{N}the Jewel of Light.{W1}

0CB1=Something has happened to{N}Mitula....{W1}
0CB2=I can't see Zeon.{W1}
0CB3=What do you mean?{W1}
0CB4=He's still in Arc Valley.{W2}
0CB5=He has revived, but he has{N}not recovered his full{N}strength yet.{W1}
0CB6=But, he has already created{N}
0CB7=a lot of mischief on the{N}ground...{W2}
0CB8=Is he that powerful?{W1}
0CB9=He is.{N}His power...{W1}
0CBA=His power what?{W1}

0CC6=Come to Arc Valley...{N}Ggggooo...!{W1}
0CC7=No!  Evil Spirit exploded!{W2}
0CC8=That's Zeon's power.{W2}
0CC9=If he revives fully, his{N}power will be unimaginably{N}strong!{W1}
0CCA=Creed, how reliable was he,{N}I mean, Evil Spirit?{W1}
0CCB=Very.{W2}

0CDB=Devils came to Pacalon{N}through Moun.{W2}
0CDC=We blocked the invaders{N}by locking the gate of Moun.{W2}
0CDD=That means, we abandoned{N}the people living there.{W1}
0CDE=We don't have enough food{N}because of the long drought.{W2}
0CDF=Just one rainfall would make{N}us happy.{W1}
0CE0={NAME;19} asked you to drop{N}by here?  Thank you!{W2}
0CE1=May I ask you a favor?{N}Please save Mitula.{N}She's in Tristan.{W2}
0CE2=We will be ruined by the{N}drought long before the{N}devils destroy us.{W1}
0CE3=You'll see a route through{N}the mountains when you go{N}north from here.{W2}

0CF5=He was shocked to find out{N}that the tunnel was blocked,{N}and went to Moun.{W1}
0CF6=Thank you, strangers!{N}You saved us!{W2}
0CF7=But I didn't think we would{N}be saved by humans!{W1}
0CF8=The King is a little upset.{W2}
0CF9=We've always believed that{N}centaurs were the best{N}warriors.{W2}
0CFA=But we were wrong.{N}I understand now.{W1}
0CFB=You defeated Zalbard and{N}saved Mitula.{W2}
0CFC=You are trustworthy{N}soldiers, so...would you{N}do me a favor?{W2}

0D2B=What a terrible waste.{N}We've lost an ancient{N}treasure.{W2}
0D2C=Anyway, we have to go to{N}Arc Valley.{N}{LEADER}, let's go.{W1}
0D2D={LEADER} tries to use{N}the {ITEM}.{W2}{N}But, he doesn't know how.{W1}
0D2E=Well, {LEADER}.  Let's go{N}back to look for someone{N}who knows about this ship.{W1}
0D2F={LEADER} fit the {ITEM}{N}into the cockpit.{W1}
0D30=You can start the ship by{N}placing the Sky Orb into{N}the cockpit.{W1}

0D41=No, {NAME;28} cannot die{N}by jumping off a cliff.{W2}
0D42={NAME;28} is an immortal{N}vampire.{W2}
0D43=But, I'm sure the impact{N}didn't feel too good.{W1}
0D44=Ah, devils finally found the{N}hidden door.{W1}
0D45=I must give the people time{N}to escape!{W1}
0D46=The priest pulls out a holy{N}symbol.{W1}
0D47=What's he doing?{W1}
0D48=He's mistaking us for devils.{W1}
0D49=What tough devils!{W2}
0D4A=My symbol doesn't drive{N}them away!{W1}
0D4B=Excuse me, we're not devils.{W1}
0D4C=I don't believe you!{W1}
0D4D=But we really...{W1}
0D4E=Brother?{W1}
0D4F={NAME;27}, they found the{N}hidden door!{W2}
0D50=I tried to drive them away{N}with this holy symbol, but{N}I failed.{W1}
0D51=Then, they're not devils.{W1}
0D52=Nobody but devils ever come{N}to such a dangerous place!{N}They must be devils!{W1}
0D53=Have you asked them?{W1}
0D54=How can we explain this?{W2}
0D55=We are from Granseal.{N}We came here to defeat the{N}devils.{W1}
0D56=Granseal?{W1}
0D57=Really?{W1}
0D58=Alright!{W1}
0D59=This is great news!{W1}
0D5A=Are you Sir Astral?{W1}
0D5B=Yes, but...I'm sorry, have{N}we met?{W1}
0D5C=I'm {NAME;27}, a son of{N}Hawel.{W2}
0D5D=Do you remember me?{W1}
0D5E=Hawel's son?{W1}
0D5F=Oh, {NAME;27}!{W2}
0D60=Yes, of course.{N}Nice to see you again.{W2}
0D61=What are you doing here?{W1}
0D62=I came back to Yeel to{N}continue my father's work.{W1}
0D63={NAME;27}, maybe you can{N}answer some questions?{W1}
0D64=I'll try.{W2}
0D65=What would you like to know?{W1}
0D66=Oh, this will be a great{N}help!{W1}
0D67=You can use the room below.{W1}
0D68=Thank you very much.{W1}
0D69=I really appreciate this.{W1}
0D6A=I heard you're going to{N}defeat the devils....{W1}
0D6B=Yep.  {LEADER} just{N}solved the secret.  We{N}can now enter the tower.{W1}
0D6C=The tower?{W2}
0D6D=Then, all these disasters{N}were caused by Zeon?{W1}
0D6E=Let me help you.{W1}
0D6F=I would like to give you{N}a hand.{W1}
0D70=Oh, thank you.{W1}
0D71=I appreciate your kindness.{W1}
0D72=...and now we're here.{W1}
0D73=Wow!  Your story is so{N}complicated.{W2}
0D74=But, from what I understand,{N}Zeon is reviving.{W2}
0D75=And all these disasters were{N}caused by him?{W1}
0D76=That's right.  We have to{N}find out where the Holy{N}Sword is.{W1}
0D77=I think I've seen it in a{N}book....{W2}
0D78=Yes, I did...but...{N}I don't remember....{W1}
0D79=It's important...{W1}
0D7A=Please, give me a moment.{W1}
0D7B=Was it this one?{W1}
0D7C=No, that's not it.{W1}
0D7D=How about this one?{W1}
0D7E=Yeah, I got it!{W1}
0D7F=Is that the right one?{W1}
0D80=Yes!  But...{W1}
0D81=But what?{W1}
0D82=The most important part is{N}missing.  It's been stolen.{W1}
0D83=Who could've taken it?{W2}
0D84=Oh, we've lost the key.{W1}
0D85=Not necessarily, Sir Astral.{W2}
0D86=Believe in {LEADER}.{N}He was chosen by the gods.{W1}
0D87=Hmmm....{W2}
0D88=Yes, {NAME;7} is right.{N}{LEADER} is our leader!{W1}
0D89={LEADER}, we have to{N}find the Holy Sword and{N}the door to the tower.{W2}
0D8A=The legends only hint of{N}you, but we believe in you.{W1}
0D8B=Believe in the power of{N}your jewel!{W1}
0D8C=Yes, that's the truth.{W1}
0D8D=Now, {LEADER}.{W1}
0D8E=We need to return and{N}restore world peace.{W1}
0D8F={LEADER}, would you mind{N}if I went with you?{W1}
0D90=No, {NAME;27}.  You have{N}to continue your work.{W1}
0D91=I knew you'd say that, but I{N}can't continue my work if{N}Zeon revives.{W2}
0D92=Also, as a historian, I{N}want to see the King of{N}the Devils.{W1}
0D93={NAME;27} will just follow{N}us if you don't let him{N}join us.{W1}
0D94={NAME;7} is right.{W1}
0D95=(Sigh)...OK.{W1}
0D96=I'm so excited!{W1}
0D97=This is not a sight-seeing{N}tour, OK?!{N}Let's go {LEADER}!{W1}
0D98=It's a fine-looking piano.{N}Will you play it?{W1}
0D99=Something opened somewhere.{W1}
0D9A={LEADER}, can't you play?{W1}
0D9B=I can't believe it!{N}I want to die, but I can't!{W1}
0D9C=A poster...{N}PULL IT!  PUSH IT!{W1}
0D9D=A book...{N}ANCIENT KINGDOMS{W1}
0D9E=A book...{N}CIVILIZATIONS{W1}
0D9F=A book...{N}THE ANCIENT TOWER{W1}
0DA0=Red Baron is {NAME;28}.{W2}
0DA1=He was running around and{N}crying for somebody to kill{N}him.{W1}
0DA2={NAME;28} went south.{N}He was acting strange.{W1}
0DA3=King Galam has not returned{N}from the war against{N}Granseal.{W1}
0DA4={NAME;28} made that hole.{W2}
0DA5=He jumped off the top of the{N}castle, but he didn't die!{W1}
0DA6=My boyfriend has not{N}returned from the war...{W2}
0DA7=I hope he's alive...{W1}
0DA8=I heard from a soldier that{N}Yeel is haunted.{W2}
0DA9=He said that he heard the{N}sound of a piano playing.{W1}
0DAA=From Granseal?  I didn't{N}know anyone survived that{N}earthquake.{W1}
0DAB=The priest of Yeel liked the{N}piano.  The ghost may be him.{W1}
0DAC=Do you know about the stautue{N}of the devil?  It appeared{N}at the Ancient Tower.{W1}
0DAD=Red Baron was looking for{N}something at the Ancient{N}Tower.{W2}
0DAE=Nobody returned from that{N}trip.  I didn't go. I was{N}smart!{W1}
0DAF=I think he was looking for{N}the Holy Sword.{W2}
0DB0=Please don't tell anybody{N}that I told you.{W1}
0DB1=I...I saw them...many devils{N}came from the tower....{W1}
0DB2=Why am I guarding the{N}kitchen?!{W1}
0DB3=You want to enter the tower?{W2}
0DB4=Impossible.  It's buried in{N}the ground and there is no{N}door.{W1}
0DB5=I heard a rumor that a{N}handsome boy is leading{N}the devils now.{W1}
0DB6=Good weapons and armor, huh?{W1}
0DB7=A statue of a devil's head.{N}It looks ready to bite you.{W1}
0DB8=A statue of a fierce{N}devil's head.  There's a{N}slit at its mouth.{W1}
0DB9=Sir Astral!  {LEADER}!{W1}
0DBA={LEADER}, wait!{W1}
0DBB=May I join your force?{W1}
0DBC=Well...{W1}
0DBD=You can trust me.{N}I'm a born fighter.{W2}
0DBE=As you know, I want to die.{W2}
0DBF=I will die fighting for your{N}cause, if you let me.{W1}
0DC0=He's a hero in Galam.{N}I think he should join us.{W1}
0DC1={NAME;28}, please come{N}with us.  You'll be a great{N}help.{W1}
0DC2=Oh, thank you!  I know I can{N}take the King of the Devils!{W1}
0DC3={W1}
0DC4=Remember.  You're our{N}leader.  We lose when you{N}are defeated.  OK?{W1}
0DC5=(Whinny!)...Oh, I love{N}going into battle!{W1}
0DC6=Stand at attention!{N}Ready for inspection, sir!!{W1}
0DC7=Sir Hawel's teachings are{N}very helpful.  Strategy was{N}his cup o' tea.{W1}
0DC8=I'm like a shadow of the{N}night.  Silent and deadly!{W1}
0DC9=Speaking...tires me.{N}Fighting...tires me.{N}I'm tired.{W1}
0DCA=Phoenix don't need a priest.{N}We can revive ourselves.{W1}
0DCB=I'm a centaur, but I can use{N}a bow and arrows!{W1}
0DCC=Those who are truly strong,{N}like me, don't need weapons!{W1}
0DCD=I love swooping in for the{N}kill!{W1}
0DCE=This is great!  I love this{N}cannon!{W1}
0DCF=We centaurs are the main{N}fighters in a battle!{N}We're awesome!{W1}
0DD0=Enemies from the sky are{N}mine.  My arrows will get{N}them!{W1}
0DD1=I trained a lot when I was{N}younger.  Style is more{N}important than strength.{W1}
0DD2=I'm not afraid of devils!{N}When's the next battle?{W1}
0DD3=I'll face any devil, any{N}time!  Bring 'em on!!{W1}
0DD4=My magic powers should be a{N}great help to you!{W1}
0DD5=I'm afraid of battle, but{N}I'll never run from the{N}enemy!{W1}
0DD6=I'm fully recovered!{N}Where's the enemy?{W1}
0DD7=I'm not as strong as you, so{N}I'll support you from the{N}sky.{W1}
0DD8=The power of nature is much{N}stronger than the devils!{W1}
0DD9=I can't forgive them!{N}Evil must be purged from the{N}Earth!{W1}
0DDA=Why are they so excited?{N}I fight for myself, not for{N}anybody else!{W1}
0DDB=Dwarves are tough.  Put me{N}in the front of the force!{W1}
0DDC=Devils, go away!{N}I'll knock you out!{W1}
0DDD=We have been fighting the{N}devils since the ancient{N}days....{W1}
0DDE=Magic sure is helpful in a{N}battle, isn't it?{W1}
0DDF=Like {NAME;7}, I'll{N}never die.  I don't care{N}how difficult the battle is!{W1}
0DE0=I was created by ancient{N}magic.  It's my destiny{N}to defeat the devils!{W1}
0DE1={W1}
0DE2=Have you ever noticed how{N}short {NAME;3} is?{W1}
0DE3=I'm a lot taller than{N}{NAME;3}.  He, he...(whinny)!{W1}
0DE4=Ouch...{NAME;1} just told me{N}how short I was....{W1}
0DE5=Using magic tires me out.{N}I need to rest a lot.{W1}
0DE6=I'm thinking of a way to{N}steal more treasure after{N}the battle.{W1}
0DE7=I'm practicing...{N}dodge...dodge....{N}(Whew)...I'm tired!{W1}
0DE8={LEADER}, do you think I'm{N}a snob?{N}I heard a rumor about me!{W1}
0DE9=What is Grans like?{N}I'm from the country, so I{N}really like cities!{W1}
0DEA=Grrrr...Grrrrrrr...is that{N}enough?  I try to be brutal.{W1}
0DEB=I prefer the battle area to{N}the Caravan.{W1}
0DEC=The Ancients were so smart!{N}Moving about in a vehicle{N}is wonderful!{W1}
0DED={LEADER}, adventuring{N}with you is more exciting{N}than I expected!{W1}
0DEE=Wow...it sure is nice to{N}rest after a hard battle.{W1}
0DEF=There are many centaurs in{N}this force, but I think I'm{N}the most valuable one!{W1}
0DF0={NAME;3} sure is cute,{N}even if he is kinda short.{W1}
0DF1=Hey, are you crazy?!{N}Put me in battle!{W1}
0DF2=Young men nowadays are so{N}difficult to understand.{N}Am I getting old...?{W1}
0DF3=I'm just happy to be with{N}{NAME;13}!{W1}
0DF4=I can't kill myself.  Why?{N}I'm not a vampire, am I?{W1}
0DF5=Are you surprised to see how{N}fast I grew?{N}So am I!{W1}
0DF6=Mitula looks young, but she{N}is actually quite old.{W1}
0DF7=Blast!{N}This is so exciting!{W1}
0DF8=I like this!  Free food!{W1}
0DF9=Travel is my hobby!{N}See this souvenir?{N}It's for my wife, and....{W1}
0DFA=Let me fight!  C'mon!{N}No one is a match for a{N}master monk!{W1}
0DFB=(Click, click)...oh, I have{N}to oil my body sometimes.{W1}
0DFC=Do I behave haughty?{N}They seldom talk to me.{N}(Sob...sob){W1}
0DFD=Give me your hand...oh, am I{N}still cold?  But, I'm alive.{W1}
0DFE=They say I'm dirty!  Is it{N}because I've never washed{N}my body before?!{W1}
0DFF=You're not devils, are you?{W2}
0E00=How did you get here safely?{W1}
0E01=I'm hungry....{W1}
0E02=Are you strong?  Will you{N}please kill the devils?{W1}
0E03=Pacalon soldiers are so{N}proud!{W2}
0E04=But, they're just cowards{N}that hide in the castle.{W1}
0E05=What will we do when we{N}lose?{W1}
0E06=Do you know Geshp?{W2}
0E07=He sometimes comes here.{N}He seems so friendly.{W2}
0E08=Are all devils like him?{N}If so, I like them.{W1}
0E09=Do you think Pacalon can{N}beat the devils?{W2}
0E0A=Say yes!  Pacalon has the{N}best fighters in the world!{W1}
0E0B=This is Pacalon, a kingdom{N}of fine centaurs.{W2}
0E0C=We welcome you.{W1}
0E0D=Rain!  This must be a{N}present from the gods!{W1}
0E0E=Thanks to the rain, I'm no{N}longer thirsty.{N}But, I'm still hungry.{W1}
0E0F=Did you save Mitula?{W2}
0E10=Then, why don't you defeat{N}those devils?{W1}
0E11=Was Tristan occupied by{N}devils?{W2}
0E12=That's why we've had no{N}rain lately.{W1}
0E13=I see Geshp frequently.{N}He always stares at the{N}castle.{W1}
0E14=Unbelievable!  You've{N}finally arrived.{W1}
0E15=Creed...I mean, Mr...{W1}
0E16=That's OK, {NAME;7}.{N}I doubted you'd ever make{N}it here.{W2}
0E17=The enemies you've faced so{N}far were strong.{W1}
0E18=Yes, they were.{W1}
0E19=Why am I here?  Is that your{N}question, {LEADER}?{W2}
0E1A=I wanted to help you.{W2}
0E1B=There is no church around{N}here.  Think of me as a{N}priest.{W1}
0E1C=Now, what can I do for you?{W1}
0E1D=Who is it?  Petro?{W1}
0E1E=Well, who are you?{W1}
0E1F=Petro?  Is he back?{W1}
0E20=Petro!  The Sky Orb is OUR{N}treasure!  Give it back!{W2}
0E21=Say something!{N}Petro!{W1}
0E22=Oh, you're not Petro.{N}Who...are you?{W1}
0E23=Ancient stone?  Yes, my{N}family had it for a long{N}time.{W2}
0E24=But, it was stolen.{W1}
0E25=His brother, my grandson,{N}took the stone, the Sky Orb,{N}when he left.{W2}
0E26=I think he went to Grans{N}Island to operate an ancient{N}vehicle.{W2}
0E27=I've lost my purpose to live.{W1}
0E28=He spent all his spare time{N}studying the Sky Orb.{W2}
0E29=It is quite old.{N}He deduced that our{N}ancestors could fly.{W2}
0E2A=The last known location of{N}the Nazca Ship was Grans.{W1}
0E2B=You need my help?{W1}
0E2C=Come in.  Talk to me.{W1}
0E2D=I came here looking for{N}ancient treasure, and found{N}the Sky Orb.{W2}
0E2E=Also, I discovered how to{N}use the ancient tunnels.{W2}
0E2F=But, most of them are{N}useless, except for the{N}one to Grans.{W1}
0E30=To Grans?{W1}
0E31=Can we get to Grans Island{N}through it?{W1}
0E32=Yes.  Do you want to go{N}there?{W2}
0E33=Really?{W2}
0E34=You'll go to Grans with me.{N}Let's go now!{W1}
0E35={LEADER} decides to go{N}with him.{W1}
0E36=All I want is the Sky Orb.{N}Just help me get that, and{N}then you can leave.{W1}
0E37=Good luck.{W2}
0E38=If you see my brother,{N}please tell him that I'm OK.{W1}
0E39=Oh, what a pity.{N}You can't go to Grans.{W1}
0E3A=It's my job!{W1}
0E3B=Row...sham...bow!{W1}
0E3C=OK, you go first!{W1}
0E3D=I'm Paseran of Ribble.{N}I'm studying the ancient{N}petroglyphs.{W2}
0E3E={NAME;11} told me about{N}a family who has an ancient{N}tomb in Parmecia.{W2}
0E3F=According to my studies,{N}his house should be around{N}here somewhere.{W2}
0E40=Or, maybe it's to the east.{W1}
0E41=I feel...a power returning{N}me to human.{W2}
0E42=Hey!  The evil is gone!{N}Did you chase them away?{W1}
0E43={LEADER}, who is she?{W1}
0E44=Did you say {LEADER}?{N}Oh, you're from Granseal!{W1}
0E45=Yes, we are, but who are{N}you?{W1}
0E46=Do you know how long I've{N}been here as a stone statue?{W1}
0E47=How do you know {LEADER}?{W1}
0E48=Oh, I'm sorry.{W2}
0E49=I'm {NAME;21}, a sorceress.{N}Goddess Mitula told me about{N}you.{W1}
0E4A=She did?{W1}
0E4B=Yes.  She was worried about{N}you.{W2}
0E4C=You are fated to fight Zeon.{W2}
0E4D=But, she is unable to help{N}you.  It's an order from{N}Volcanon.{W2}
0E4E=But, I'm here for her.{N}I'm here to help you.{W1}
0E4F=You want to go to Grans,{N}right?  Then, I think we{N}can use the ancient ship.{W2}
0E50=Let's go to Nazca.{W1}
0E51=Arc Valley is a dark place{N}where evil gathers.{W2}
0E52=He who rules Arc Valley is{N}the King of the Devils.{W1}
0E53=Dark Sol, Dark Dragon and{N}Zeon fought desperately to{N}obtain Arc Valley.{W2}
0E54=The fighting of the devil{N}kings created a mighty storm.{W1}
0E55=Zeon won.  And every devil{N}named him the King of the{N}Devils.{W2}
0E56=The other two kings envied{N}Zeon.  They sealed his powers{N}inside the Jewel of Evil.{W1}
0E57=When Zeon lost his powers,{N}he fell to Earth, and created{N}a giant crater when he hit.{W2}
0E58=His moan destroyed the{N}mountains and the crater{N}was buried by the debris.{W1}
0E59=Grieving over the fight, the{N}God of Wisdom created the{N}Jewel of Light.{W2}
0E5A=The Jewel of Light chose a{N}brave man and gave him a{N}Holy Sword.{W1}
0E5B=With the Holy Sword in{N}hand, the brave man fought{N}against the two devil kings.{W2}
0E5C=The Holy Sword contained{N}holy power.  Thus, the two{N}devil kings were defeated.{W1}
0E5D=Evil Arc Valley was sealed{N}beneath the Ancient Tower.{W2}
0E5E=Never open the door to the{N}tower.  A great evil sleeps{N}inside.{W1}
0E5F=In the event of Zeon{N}awakening, the power of light{N}will choose another.{W2}
0E60=Believe us.  We lie not.{N}Attack the devil at his mouth{N}with the Holy Sword.{W1}
0E61={LEADER} defeated Red{N}Baron too?  Is that what{N}you said, Geshp?{W1}
0E62=Yes, sir...I'm sorry.{W1}
0E63=Once again, my minions have{N}failed me.{W2}
0E64=Are my soldiers that weak?{W1}
0E65=Yes...oh, no!  I mean, they{N}were strong enough.{W2}
0E66=But {LEADER} and his force{N}were smarter.{W1}
0E67=No more excuses!{W2}
0E68=This is your last chance.{N}Kill {LEADER} this time,{N}or I'll kill you!{W1}
0E69=Ah...yes, sir.  I'll kill{N}{LEADER} this time.{N}I stake my life on it.{W1}
0E6A=Bring the Jewel of Evil back{N}to me!{W1}
0E6B=Yes, sir!{W1}
0E6C=You were right, Odd Eye.{W1}
0E6D=Of course.{W1}
0E6E=I can't trust Geshp anymore.{W2}
0E6F=If he fails, you must battle{N}{LEADER}.{W1}
0E70=You want me to kill{N}{LEADER}?{W2}
0E71=He's probably much stronger{N}now.{N}Hmmm, sounds interesting.{W2}
0E72=I'll do it.  If this comes{N}to pass, it will be his final{N}battle.{W1}
0E73={LEADER} is almost here{N}already?{W1}
0E74=Yes, sir.  With an ancient{N}aircraft.  He'll be passing{N}over the cape soon.{W1}
0E75=Good.  I'll do anything to{N}get my powers back.{W1}
0E76=They're stronger than we{N}thought.{W2}
0E77=But, I have an idea.  Please{N}let me try it.{W1}
0E78=Well?{W1}
0E79=I think it's better for us{N}to shoot them down over the{N}
0E7A=cape.{W1}
0E7B=I agree.{W1}
0E7C=Thank you.  Then... may I{W2}
0E7D=borrow Odd Eye?{W1}
0E7E=He's still damaged from his{N}battle against Volcanon.{W2}
0E7F=Take Red Baron instead.{W1}
0E80=Thank you, sir.{W1}
0E81=They'll be passing over the{N}cape soon.  Go!{W1}
0E82=Yes, sir!{W1}
0E83=That Geshp!  He wants{N}everything.{W1}
0E84=You noticed that too?{W1}
0E85=Yes, King Zeon.{W2}
0E86=I'm afraid Geshp can't stop{N}{LEADER}'s advance.{W1}
0E87=You really think so?{W1}
0E88=I was just thinking of{N}{LEADER}'s hidden powers.{W2}
0E89=We must never underestimate{N}him.{W1}
0E8A=Anyway, it will be a{N}fantastic show!  Ha, ha!{W1}
0E8B=Finish the preparations{N}before the Nazca Ship flies{N}over the cape!{W1}
0E8C=How are the Prism Flowers?{W1}
0E8D=They're ready!{W1}
